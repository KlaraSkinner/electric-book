# Good mothers take their children to the park.

---

---

Most days back then – before it all happened – I took Amy to the park.

I spent hours there.

The people you see in the park depend on the time of day that you go. In the mornings, I saw mostly nannies, small flocks pecking at the day’s gossip in their generic overalls, sweat collecting at the edge of their doeks. They brought babies who lay gurgling on blankets, or who slept quietly in the cocoon of warmth on a nanny’s back. Black women looking after white babies. Then Amy and I would arrive, the ultimate anomaly at the playground: a white woman with her cappuccino-coloured baby.

The nannies sometimes smiled at me, and one large, friendly looking woman always waved at me from across the grass. If she walked past, she would say, ‘Good morning, my sis-tah,’ smiling like we shared a secret. Sometimes I fantasised about stealing her to come to work for me, with her large chestful of love. But there were, of course, several reasons this wouldn’t work. The first was Gugu, the woman who already worked for us. And the second was the unavoidable fact that my friend was so fat that she could barely pick up her little charges, a pair of red-headed twins. Amy needed someone like Gugu – whippet-like in shape and movement, capable of catching my little girl, who sometimes seemed to be answering the call of the urban forest beyond. But mostly the nannies ignored me, making me feel strangely isolated and unwanted, flashes school girls randomly picking me as the week’s pariah.

At midday in the week, the park was mostly empty. Even I seldom went then, partly because of the heat, and partly because Amy napped, which gave me a few precious hours to paint. Sometimes the nap eluded us, and in desperation Amy and I would set off, occasionally finding her nap along the way. But being at the park alone except for the sleepy-looking security guard made me jumpy.

Once, I took Gugu with me for company, and the safety of numbers. But she was on edge, worrying that Amy might fall off the slide, and kept mentioning the ironing she had waiting. I’d fooled myself into thinking that a trip to the park might be a treat for her, a break from domestic drudgery. Instead, I was left feeling guilty and stupid for having dragged her away from a full day’s work, and that in turn made me feel defensive and angry. So I didn’t take her to the park again.

Although, if Amy had her way, Gugu would have come with us everywhere. From when Amy was a tiny baby, she would gurgle with happiness at the sight of Gugu, and stretch her fat arms to reach for Gugu’s thin ones. If I went to my studio to work, I’d come back to find Amy curled up on Gugu’s back, or playing on her lap, sometimes just happily patting Gugu’s brown cheeks. It tortured me. For a while I stopped working so that I never had to leave Amy with her, not have to resign myself to the fact that Amy never cried or reached for me when I left or returned. But we needed the money, and to be honest, I needed my work. Needed it in a primal way that I worried about, because surely I should need my daughter more?

For the first year I constantly questioned myself – wondered if I had less motherly feelings because Amy wasn’t my biological child, and worried that she sensed it. I worried that she seemed to love Gugu more than me, not because Gugu is a dear (which she is), but because she’s black. I wondered if the connection between them was somehow more biological than ours could ever be – that Amy saw herself reflected more closely in Gugu’s dark eyes. I lay awake at night thinking about these things, and nothing Sean said could comfort me because he could never understand what it was to be a mother, what it was to compete with Gugu. Nobody had yet displaced his role as father.

Then two things happened that helped. The first came from Gugu herself. She handed Amy back to me one morning, after I had done a good few hours of work, and she smiled and said, ‘This baby, she loves her mommy *too* much.’

I hid my face in Amy’s warm neck to hide my delight, breathing in her baby-smell. ‘Really?’ I muttered.

‘Hau,’ said Gugu, ‘this Amy is a mommy’s girl.’

I could have kissed her.

The second thing that made me feel better was a woman I met at the park. She was sitting near me one afternoon, watching her child – a carbon copy of her, with thick black hair and large blue eyes – who was playing with their nanny. The woman sighed and turned to me, saying, ‘Doesn’t it kill you how they seem to love the nanny better? I swear, I’m never bringing her with to the park again.’

I looked at her. ‘Really?’ I said. ‘You too?’

The woman laughed. ‘Honey,’ she said, ‘all my friends have this struggle. We love our nannies; we’d die without them. But we want to kill them.’

That was Rose. My first park friend.

Because that was when mommies came to the park: in the late afternoon, driving or strolling or carrying or pushing their babies, toddlers and children. Not for us the friendly ease of the nanny flock, but a careful sitting in our own spaces, or playing with our own children, until some hidden barrier came down, and tentative overtures of friendliness were made between women who’d seen each other many times before.

To me, Rose was magnificent. Her face seemed friendly – open and honest, with her wide, lipsticked smile and glowing sapphire eyes. Over the slow afternoons that I got to know her, I noticed that Rose asked questions and really listened to the answers. She never seemed to judge, and always had a kind word for another mother, like, ‘It’s so fucking hard. Isn’t it?’ I loved the way she swore, even in front of the children; I was always so annoyed by mothers with silly little-child voices designed not to traumatise children, even when they were talking to adults. Not Rose.

She didn’t talk about herself a lot – it was refreshing how supportive she was without dumping her own concerns right back on you. She let you know that she found motherhood hard too, without burdening you with specifics. She’d tell funny stories about herself – light, meaningless vignettes that told you next to nothing about her life, but left you feeling as if she understood.

But best of all, I could see that she adored her little girl. She hugged and kissed her whenever she came within reach, running over unself-consciously if little Maggie fell and hurt herself. She’d smack the offending play apparatus, or once the blade of grass, that Maggie had accused of hurting her. ‘Don’t hurt my Princess Sunshine,’ she would say, her arms around Maggie.

Rose was also constantly snapping pictures of Maggie on her phone, and after I had known her for a few weeks, she started taking pictures of Amy and I, and sending them to me, often with a wry comment. There was one that always made me laugh – me looking completely worn out and Amy almost climbing on my shoulders, looking like a crazy person. Rose wrote, ‘Mothering. The world’s greatest joy.’ I loved knowing that Rose was a good, kind mom, but that she didn’t seem to judge other moms. It made me feel normal and accepted. Or, at least, accepted by Rose.

Rose also dressed differently to everyone else. At the park most mothers wore either jeans and T-shirts, or kind of earth-mothery outfits in brown and beige and white, which flowed and hid their bodies. The jeans women wore takkies and slops, and the earth moms wore Jesus-sandals, and sensible flat shoes in winter.

Rose wore bright colours and preferred skirts and dresses, even though they’re not practical for the playground. Her shoes were ballet pumps in jewel colours. She wore interesting beads, and would unwind Maggie’s little fingers from her necklaces saying, ‘Those are *mine*, Princess Sunshine.’ She was unapologetically large, but in a Rubinesque, Nigella-ry way that made you want to run out and buy a kilogram of chocolate so that you too could have a plunging cleavage and a soft embrace for a toddler. She hugged and kissed Amy too, after a while. Amy loved it, and soon she would run to Rose, flinging her small self around Rose’s ample legs.

Rose, with her friendly facade, taught me so much. She taught me about the importance of reaching out to other mothers, about not judging women who are doing the same hard job as you as best they can and, most of all, about being honest about how very hard motherhood is. Those were the things she talked about. And those were the things I saw her do. Rose changed how I felt about myself as a mother, and as a woman. She changed the way I behaved, and she made me reach out more.

I often wonder though – without Rose, would I have met Lilith?

# Good mothers are friendly and make good friends.

I fell into a pattern. Most days, I would set off to the park mid-afternoon. Often, if we hadn’t said anything the day before, I would text Rose and see if she was going. Sometimes I’d go even if she wasn’t. But if I knew she’d be there, I always went. I think that Rose enjoyed seeing me as much as I enjoyed seeing her, and she quickly felt like one of my best friends, even though I actually knew very little about her.

My real, since always, best friend, Lerato, was very suspicious of Rose.

Lerato and I met at school – one of the few co-ed, progressive private schools in Joburg in those days, which tended to attract the children of the odd and alternative. In my case, I’d first gone to the local government school, but had found myself deeply unhappy when I started at the high school. My primary-school friends had emigrated, or moved, or found new, cooler friends. Instead of being one of the acceptable if not wildly popular kids as I’d been at primary school, I suddenly became decidedly unpopular, and more and more unhappy, although I tried desperately to hide it from my parents. My marks dropped, I became unsociable and I stayed in my room most of the time when I was at home. I thought about vomiting, something I knew teenagers were supposed to do to feel better, but I wasn’t brave enough to try. And anyway, I wasn’t actually worried about my weight – in my misery, if anything, I was too thin. Every morning I had to push a great heavy rock of worry off my chest just to get out of bed.

Eventually, after a week where everyone – *everyone* – in my class had called me ‘Stink Bomb Becky’ and made fart noises whenever I was around, I finally broke down and told my mom how miserable I was. She held me while I cried, and then said she would sort it out. I protested, knowing my life would become truly unbearable if my mom said anything to anyone at school. But she shushed me and told me to trust her to do the right thing.

I trusted her to do what *she* thought was the right thing, but I didn’t think she really understood what it was like to be bullied and unpopular and helpless.

I heard my parents talking that night, into the dark hours, their voices rising and falling while my brother, Carl, slept soundly in the room next to mine. I guessed they were discussing what to tell the teachers, and how to help me stand up to my tormenters. At the thought of getting up and going to school, I thought I would stop breathing.

The next morning my mom surprised me. She said that I didn’t have to put on my school uniform or go to school. She took the day off work, and spent it on the phone to schools that my dad and her thought might be better for me. I could see the needles of worry knitting her brow as she wrote down their fees, but for myself, I felt like someone had turned the oxygen back on.

In the afternoon, she took me off to see a school where they had an immediate space because someone was emigrating. I swear, as soon as I stepped through the gate, I knew I would be happy there. I can’t explain what it was, but there was an aura around the teachers and pupils that said, ‘We’ll accept you as you are.’ And even though the fees were about ten times my previous school, and my mom and dad didn’t really have the money, I was enrolled. When I tentatively asked how they would afford it, my mom told me that was their business, not mine, and that it would be fine.

Before that day, I had loved my parents. But with this decision, which literally saved me, my love became unbreakable. I discarded the hedgehog prickles of adolescence, and devoted myself to showing them that they’d made the right decision.

It was pre-1994, and Lerato was one of two black children in my class. It wasn’t that the school was exclusionary, but it was situated in the deep northern suburbs (‘This was all farmland when I was a boy,’ my father said every single morning as we drove to school. Every. Single. Morning) and although change was in the air, racially mixed schooling was still the exception rather than the rule. So in my class there was Millicent-Ann, leading to the nickname Milan, who’d been adopted by a white family in the days when this was positively outrageous and possibly illegal, and Lerato. Lerato was the only child of a couple who would later be called struggle heroes. Her parents were still in exile then, but they’d sent her home to live with her aunt, so that she could be schooled in South Africa. Lerato was a little bit foreign and a little bit exotic and totally bewitching to the fourteen-year-old me. From the first day, when I was seated next to her, I adored her. And, to my utmost surprise, the feeling was mutual.

From the beginning, we were different. Lerato was academically strong and excelled in subjects like maths and history – both of which tripped me up. Although my marks began to improve at the new school, I was never going to be a doctor or a lawyer. The thing I discovered, that had somehow gone unnoticed before, was art. I’d always liked drawing and messing around with paint, glue and scissors and sparkly things. My previous teachers hadn’t seen anything special in it, and my parents had expressed the ordinary pride they expressed in almost anything I did. But the art teacher at my new school got all excited about me and suddenly, instead of being ‘Stink Bomb Becky’, I was ‘talented Rebecca’. For matric I did subjects like art and photography (because that was the kind of school it was), and when Lerato went to Wits to study Law, I was right there too, doing Fine Arts.

Lerato was disparaging about my ‘arty’ friends, and because I got involved in political and environmental causes, she’d refer to my ‘hefty-lefties’ and ‘tree-huggers’. ‘If we hadn’t met so young,’ she used to say, ‘I would worry that I was just your token black friend.’ And that was Lerato: bitingly honest, often too close to the bone; always my friend.

When I had a child, she referred to my ‘mummified friends’ in much the same way. After she met Rose at my house one afternoon, she took double umbrage and called her ‘that arty-mummy woman’.

‘You can’t trust those types,’ she told me, smoothing the pencil-sharp creases in her pants, and tapping her manicured nails ominously on her knee. ‘Watch. This. Space.’

I ignored her, mostly because if I only chose friends approved by Lerato Mofokeng, I wouldn’t have any.

\*\*\*

Rose and I noticed Lilith at the park about a week before we spoke to her. She was sitting next to one of the other park regulars, a woman called Sophie, who only allowed her twin boys to eat organic food, and thought that Rose and I were the Antichrist of motherhood for the abandon with which we flung Flings at ours. When we’d first spoken to Sophie, Rose had nodded sympathetically as Sophie bemoaned the challenges of finding properly certified organic vegetables.

‘It’s so hard, isn’t it?’ Rose had said while calmly opening a packet of lurid orange Niknaks for Maggie. Then she told Sophie a funny story about trying to buy organic carrots, where the shop assistant had sent her to the pet shop because she’d thought she was asking for parrots. I laughed at the story, even though Rose was actually repeating something that had been told to both of us by another mom the week before. That, after all, was Rose’s gift – finding the right thing to say to everyone.

When we saw Lilith together that first time, she was sitting next to Sophie, hugging her knees to her body, her head cocked to listen to something Sophie was saying, her eyes fixed on her little girl, who was playing nearby. Lilith was blonde, her hair cut short, and tucked behind her ears. Her features were fine, and when she smiled a fan of lines spread across the side of her nose. There was something translucent about her skin, making her seem other-worldly, and she had just a light scattering of freckles. She was slight, but in a way that suggested strength – I could imagine her running, or horse riding. Something outdoorsy.

‘She seems very friendly,’ said Rose, with a nod towards Lilith. ‘She’s always talking to different people.’

‘She looks nice,’ I said. I wasn’t really sure I believed this though. Possibly I should have said that she looked interesting. But Rose always thought that people looked ‘nice’, and we were still in that phase of friendship where you want to agree.

We watched her for a while. I don’t know what Rose saw, but I was fascinated by the way the woman’s eyes almost never left her child, although you could tell that she was also listening properly to Sophie.

We watched Lilith and Sophie a few more times after that; they seemed like Rose and me – best park friends. And then, maybe a week later, Lilith arrived at the park, and instead of walking over to Sophie, she ambled over to Rose and me, holding her daughter’s hand.

‘Hi,’ she said when she reached us, shielding her eyes with her hand. ‘I’m Lilith Browne. With an “e”.’ She stopped and laughed. ‘I always say that – it’s like a nervous tic. Obviously you don’t need to know how to spell my surname.’ She laughed again, and I recognised that she was a bit anxious about introducing herself to strangers, but still determined enough to do it. ‘Mind if I join you?’

‘Sure,’ said Rose before I had a chance to speak. ‘I’m Rose MacFarlane, and this is Rebecca Prince.’ She pointed to Amy and Maggie, who were uncharacteristically playing together. ‘Those are our girls.’

Lilith pushed her daughter slightly forward – a slight blonde girl with big eyes, dressed in layers of leggings, net skirts, clashing colours and sparkles. You could tell that this was a little girl who knew her own style. You could almost hear the echo of the morning entreaties to wear something normal.

‘This is my daughter, Ruby-Mae,’ said Lilith.

‘Ruby Ruby,’ said her daughter emphatically.

Lilith sighed, but her eyes were smiling. ‘Fine,’ she said. ‘This is my daughter Ruby Ruby.’

Rose and I laughed. ‘Hi, Ruby Ruby,’ we both said.

Lilith sat down next to us, and Ruby ran over to the jungle gym. Lilith looked at us, and I noticed what an unusual colour her eyes were, a blue-green grey, and one eye had a freckle in it.

‘Rebecca and Rose,’ said Lilith, ‘please tell me you’re not neurotic about organic food?’

Rose burst out laughing in that generous way of hers. ‘Has Sophie been at you?’

Lilith’s laugh was a throaty gurgle. ‘She’s very nice. But she’s absolutely obsessed.’

We all looked over at Sophie, who was carefully not making eye contact, and I felt a bit sad for her.

‘Should we call her over?’ I said.

‘I know I’m being like a horrible teenager,’ said Lilith, ‘but please, just one day off.’

We all laughed again, and when Sophie looked over, Lilith waved and mouthed ‘Hello,’ and Sophie looked slightly mollified.

‘Now,’ said Lilith. ‘Tell me about yourselves.’

Afterwards, Rose said that being with Lilith was like being interviewed by a journalist. I thought that I had probably been interviewed by more journalists than Rose, and I disagreed; it seemed like the first session with a psychologist. She asked us question after question, not allowing us time between to ask her anything about herself. And most of the time, while we were answering, she nodded and made appropriate responses, but kept her eyes on Ruby.

Ruby-Mae’s hair was the same colour as Lilith’s, a fine blonde, and I watched Amy carefully, worried she might pull it. Amy had a thing about blonde hair. It seemed to call to her, and once her fingers had made contact, it was like she wanted to take it all for herself. Obviously, the people whose heads the blonde hair was attached to were seldom sympathetic, and Amy had a bit of a reputation at the park as a hair puller. It broke my heart, because I knew she meant no harm.

I saw that Amy had noticed Ruby-Mae’s hair because her little head cocked to the side, her lively brown eyes watching her, and I stood up, ready to stop the pulling. But Amy reached for Ruby’s hair and stroked it, something I’d never seen her do before. Then she wrapped her arms around Ruby and yelled loud enough for us to hear, ‘Love!’

Lilith laughed, and so did I, although more with relief than anything else. I explained about Amy and the hair, worrying that maybe Lilith would stop Ruby-Mae from playing with such a rough little girl.

Lilith’s reaction was the first thing about her that surprised me.

‘I guess Amy likes Ruby-Mae,’ said Lilith, and I heard happiness in her voice.

‘I think she must,’ I agreed, watching the girls race up the steps to the slide together.

Then Rose clapped her hands and called out to the girls that it was time to start packing up.

\*\*\*

The next day Lilith was there again, and she waved at me, but stayed talking to a mother I’d never seen before. Ruby and Amy found each other and played together, but Lilith didn’t join me. I felt a bit rejected as I left, and I couldn’t help wondering what it was that I’d said, or if it was indeed Amy’s hair-pulling. Or if maybe it was Rose she’d wanted to make friends with.

But after that one time, she joined me every time we saw each other at the park, whether I was alone or with Rose. She always seemed delighted to see us, and would often leave off chatting to another person when we arrived. While conversation was always a little unbalanced – with Lilith asking questions, me answering, and Rose telling light-hearted stories – we grew to really like her.

And, slowly, Rose and I opened our little circle to include Lilith.

# Good mothers open their homes.

---

---

It wasn’t long before Rose and I started having playdates at each other’s houses. Rose, being Rose, invited me first, and Maggie clapped her little hands with happiness the first time we made plans to visit. It turned out that Rose lived very nearby, and visiting her was actually a lot more convenient than going to the park.

It had been a long time since I’d made new friends – not really since university. My work as an artist is mostly solitary, and although I’d met some nice people through galleries, I hadn’t made what my mom would call ‘house friends’. So I felt a bit anxious about visiting Rose – it felt a bit like a test.

Her house, just up the road from us, was very like Rose herself: colourful, generous and a bit over the top. When I was in her home, I suddenly felt like my own carefully chosen furniture and décor was exactly that – careful. It’s strange; I’m an artist, so you’d think I’d feel confident about colour, but in Rose’s home it felt like she was the artist. She also had the most lovely art collection – and to my enormous gratification, she had a small one of my Dogs.

My Dogs are the reason that I’m well known, and the reason I make a fairly good living for an artist. For years I painted either landscapes or what I call ‘roomscapes’. I tried to make them a bit quirky and fun, and in my studio I had a giant mood board with images I admired or that had caught my eye. My landscapes typically had animals, or the odd figure, and my rooms most often featured cats and tea – the idea being to create a picture of a space that the viewer wants to be sitting in. I sold just enough to scrape by, and supplemented my painting with some illustration work.

One day, feeling uninspired, I doodled a picture of a few dogs. Choosing almost at random, I redrew the doodle of a dachshund onto a small canvas, and put him in a garden. I used starker lines than those in my usual style, and coloured the dog a bright blue, while the garden around him was muted. It was fun, and when I finished I put it aside, and went back to my work with renewed vigour. After that, whenever I felt stuck, I used my dachshund to break the block. I painted five over the course of four months, each time a different colour and in a different setting. Nothing would have come of it except that one day, one of the up-and-coming dealers who sold fairly regularly for me – like two or three times a year – popped in to collect stock and saw the little stack of canvases in the corner of my studio.

‘What are these?’ she asked, turning one to face her.

‘Nothing.’ I blushed. The dachshunds felt too easy to be real art, and I was a bit embarrassed by the way they had simply flowed from my brush.

‘I like them,’ said Joanne. ‘Can I take three?’

‘They’re not real art,’ I said, in my panic telling her my real fear.

Joanne laughed, her blonde head thrown back. ‘What the fuck is *real* *art*?’ she said, with a mocking edge. She patted my arm. ‘Let me try with these.’

I shrugged. ‘What the hell. But don’t blame me when nobody takes me seriously ever again.’

‘No offence, angel,’ said Joanne, with what I came to know as her characteristic bluntness, ‘but nobody’s exactly taking you seriously right now.’

Ouch.

To my surprise, Joanne sold those first three Dogs for a good price within two weeks. She doubled the price, and sold the remaining two within another week.

She phoned me at the end of that month. ‘We’re onto something here,’ she said. ‘I’m clearing the gallery, and I want fifty Dogs for a show in two months’ time.’

It shouldn’t have been possible, but they were so easy that I did it. In fact, we had more paintings than we needed, and Joanne got quite frenzied trying to choose her favourites.

‘What do you think we should ask?’ she said.

I named a price, she tripled it, and the whole show sold out. I suddenly had money and, more insanely, was becoming quite famous. Something about those Dogs appealed to people, and magazines and newspapers kept ringing up for interviews. Then it started with radio and TV, and suddenly everyone knew who I was. We did a series of prints to make the Dogs affordable, and we sold greeting cards.

I kept thinking it would pass, or my ability to paint dogs would dry up, but it didn’t. When Amy came, I slowed down a lot – but every Dog I paint still sells.

So when I saw a Dog at Rose’s house, I smiled and pointed at it. It was a small original, but she still would have paid a good price for it.

‘Ah,’ said Rose, ‘my Rebecca Williams. I just wish I could afford more of her work.’

I blushed. I never really know how to do this part.

‘This is a bit embarrassing,’ I said, ‘but I —’

Rose interrupted me. ‘You’ve never heard of her? She’s magnificent! You must see the cards she does. And the big paintings – you’ll die.’

I put my hand on Rose’s arm. ‘Rose, I *have* heard of her. I *am* Rebecca Williams.’

For the first time since I’d met her, Rose was at a loss. Her eyes narrowed slightly. ‘But your surname is Prince,’ she eventually said.

‘That’s my married name. Williams is my maiden name. I became ...’ I stopped. It sounded a bit rude to say ‘I became famous’, so I changed tack. ‘I started the Dogs before I married Sean. So it seemed sensible to keep my maiden name.’

For a moment Rose stood completely still. Then, suddenly, she laughed. ‘*Of course* you’re Rebecca Williams,’ she said. ‘I should have *known* you did something amazing, given how lovely you are. Oh, this is so exciting, I could just die! Let’s have champagne to celebrate you being you.’

I laughed too. ‘I’d have a bit of a problem if I had champagne every time I was me.’

‘Or every time someone discovered that you are you,’ said Rose.

‘It happens less often than you’d think,’ I said, smiling. ‘So it still excites me when it does.’

Actually, that wasn’t the entire truth. It’s true that I still got excited when someone recognised my name, or said something good about my work – but it happened more often than I had ever imagined it would. I’d thought, after the first successful Dog Show exhibition, that if people spoke of me at all it would be in a deprecating way. I thought I’d be regarded as a sort of artistic sell-out, and my Dogs as kitsch that true art collectors wouldn’t touch. But somehow that hasn’t happened. My funny little Dogs are regarded as Serious Art, and I’m regarded as a Person to Know. Joanne calls it the ‘Picasso connection’. There’s a famous little sketch Picasso did of his dachshund, and Joanne has cleverly marketed me in a way that makes it clear that if Picasso drew daxies, then they must be the stuff of Serious Art. Criticise me, and you criticise Picasso.

I’ve been interviewed by one of Joburg’s most feted radio talk-show hosts a number of times, and each time she has said at least three times in the interview: ‘After all, Picasso drew dachshunds.’

And I have answered, as coached by Joanne: ‘There’s actually a long history of great artists drawing their dogs.’ But I follow it with a little laugh to show that I know I’m not really a great artist. Although sometimes I wonder if I’m the only person who knows that. Well, me and Lerato.

But I was glad that Rose was so excited about me, firstly because it’s always nice, but secondly because it made me feel less like the frumpy one in the friendship. And, best of all, it meant that she was a person who knew about art and my world, and I could talk to her about work, and invite her to shows. It added another level to the friendship. Lerato, it must be said, regards the whole business of my success as an extraordinary fluke. She’s right, of course, but I liked the idea of a friend who didn’t actually double over laughing when she heard that I’d sold a painting to a German collector for the same (large) amount she made in a month.

The playdate at Rose went well, and after that we’d meet in the park about once a week, and have playdates at each other’s houses one other afternoon. Rose and I also sometimes met for a coffee in the morning, me feeling guilty that Amy was with Gugu and I wasn’t working, Rose feeling guilty about nothing at all. It became one of those friendships where you feel at home in each other’s houses – a friendship where we could make tea or fetch things for the kids in each other’s kitchens. Maggie and Amy seemed to enjoy each other, and it felt good, this new friendship. I felt happier and more supported than I had since Amy came along.

It was Rose who first suggested we ask Lilith one afternoon.

I’ll be honest, I didn’t want to. I felt possessive of my friendship with Rose – I didn’t want anyone else in our magic circle. But, as Rose pointed out, there was something lonely about Lilith, something needy. And she was good company. The thing was, I was already seeing more of Lilith than Rose was, because I went to the park more often. And Lilith seemed to be there every afternoon.

‘We live in a flat,’ she explained. ‘This is our garden.’

I knew it was small-minded of me not to open my home to her, so I offered to host the first playdate where Lilith and Ruby could join Rose and me and our girls.

# Good mothers celebrate their children.

The playdate was set for a Thursday afternoon. I saw Lilith at the park on the Monday, and invited her. I already knew that Rose was available, and I SMSed her to confirm as soon as Lilith said she could make it. Rose sent a text back saying: ‘Of course. xxx’

On the Wednesday, I entertained Amy with baking. She loves baking. Her stout little arms mix and stir, and her brow furrows with concentration as she pours out my carefully premeasured ingredients. We made a cake, which at Amy’s insistence we iced pink. Then we made some more grown-up biscuits with raisins and nuts – biscuits that Amy loves to bake but hates to eat. It’s a great recipe that my mom gave me, and I phoned her while they were in the oven because it made me think of her.

‘How’s my munchkin?’ asked Mom as soon as I’d said hi.

Never in her entire mothering of me and Carl did my mother ever refer to us as something so frivolous as a ‘munchkin’. With me, she was a practical but usually somewhat emotionally and physically brittle mother. But with Amy something magical has happened, and she’s like a storybook granny. She kisses and coos and hugs and carries photos of Amy in her wallet. I think it’s partly because she was so glad when we finally stopped fertility treatment, which made me grumpy and hormonal, then manically hopeful, only to crash each time. When we adopted Amy, she was so happy for us, and has never blinked at the fact that Amy is a bit browner than the rest of the family. My father was similarly thrilled, and I think quite delighted that we’d done such a patently politically correct thing as adopt a mixed-race child. He can now hold his own amongst his academic colleagues.

Sean’s mother: different story. Sean’s parents are the sort of people who claim that they never voted for the Nationalist Party, and then add that ‘not all their ideas were wrong, of course.’

‘It’s all very well now,’ says Angela, Sean’s mother, pursing her thin lips. ‘Now we all know that it went peacefully and it’s all fine. But they could have killed us in our beds.’

Then, as one’s jaw falls open, Patrick, Sean’s father, adds, ‘They still will. Mark my words.’

When we adopted Amy, they were horrified. Of course, they didn’t say anything outright. They just made comments.

‘It’s odd how there are so few white babies for adoption, really,’ Angela said to Sean. ‘Afrikaans girls are notoriously promiscuous.’

Patrick said, ‘Surely with Rebecca’s money and connections you could have had first choice?’ as if Amy couldn’t possibly be our first choice.

As Sean has said, it’s difficult to unpack the layers of offensiveness they managed in those two statements. ‘If you sat down and tried to design a sentence that insulted more people in more ways, you actually wouldn’t be able to,’ he’s said.

‘How did you come out of those two?’ I often ask.

‘Boarding school,’ he often answers, morosely.

We shouldn’t have been surprised. They’d been similarly awful about Lerato being my only bridesmaid.

‘Doesn’t Rebecca have many friends?’ Angela had stage whispered to Sean every time she laid eyes on Lerato at the pre-wedding festivities.

It got so bad that Lerato actually took me aside and asked if I was sure I wanted to marry into this family.

‘I most decidedly don’t,’ I’d answered. ‘But I *do* want to marry Sean, so I have no choice.’

‘Fair enough,’ Lerato had said, and had pretended not to speak English the few times Angela or Patrick addressed her.

‘They’ll probably just ask me to clean something,’ she’d said.

Couldn’t argue with that.

It would be an exaggeration to say that we weren’t speaking to Sean’s parents at that point in our lives. Sean phoned once every two weeks – he actually had it programmed into his calendar app so he wouldn’t forget. The conversations were stilted, from what I could hear. We saw them about twice a year, even though they live ten minutes’ drive from us. We’d see them on Sean’s birthday, when they usually came to our house. And we’d see them briefly at some point around Christmas. They never held Amy when she was a baby, they never touched her, and they have yet to remember her birthday. When they saw her, they’d say, ‘Hello Amy,’ as if – well, I was about to say as if she was a pet dog, but they’re actually rather enthusiastic about dogs.

The irony is that I suspect they boasted to their friends about their relationship to Rebecca Williams, the famous artist. Probably not any more, though.

So it’s my parents who have always been Amy’s Granny and Gramps. Plus, my brother, Carl, loves Amy and so does Sean’s sister, Susan, so Amy has a loving aunt and uncle. For the most part, I can’t say she notices the hole that Angela and Patrick Prince have left in her life.

When I phoned my mom after our baking, she’d just bumped into Angela Prince at the shops. I don’t think she would have told me about it if it hadn’t just happened, or if she’d had a chance to tell my dad first. But she told me.

‘I just made your biscuits with Amy,’ I said.

‘I just saw Angela Prince at Woolies,’ she replied. ‘Not the one near me, the one in Hyde Park – it’s the only one where you can get your dad’s mackerel. I really don’t understand why they can’t all have the same stock ...’ Left to her own devices, my mom can sidetrack herself a thousand times, and there was a chance I’d never hear the thing about Angela.

‘So how was Angela?’ I asked.

Mom took a deep breath – one I recognised as a pre-rant wind-up.

‘That woman,’ she said, ‘that woman is a bitch, Rebecca. There’s no getting around it, and I’m not one to use that word lightly.’ The last part wasn’t quite true, but I let it pass.

‘What did she say?’ I asked.

‘She said,’ Mom took a deep breath, ‘she said that she’d heard about an adoption agency that brings little blonde Russian children to South Africa, and that maybe you could – and I quote, Rebecca – she said, “Maybe they could trade Amy.”’

‘Oh God, Mom. You have *got* to be making that up.’

‘Do you think I could make up this ... this ... this *shit*?’

I got Mom off the phone finally, after promising her many times that I wasn’t upset by what she’d told me, and that I wouldn’t tell Angela that she’d told me.

‘To tell Angela,’ I said, ‘I would have to speak to her. And Sean’s birthday has just been, so we’re safe till Christmas.’

‘You’re a saint the way you put up with her, Rebecca,’ concluded my mother, as if I’d just said we saw Angela twice a week instead of twice a year.

The truth is, I was very upset.

I don’t know why; it’s not like I don’t expect it of Angela. But I hated the thought of *anyone* thinking of Amy in those terms. I suppose it went to the heart of all my insecurities: that Amy was less mine than a biological child would be.

I phoned Lerato after my mom, Amy in a baking-induced nap.

The thing about an old friend, unlike a new friend like Rose, is that you don’t have to explain. When Lerato answered the phone, I said, ‘My mother-in-law is a bitch.’

Lerato took a moment and then said, ‘The gestation period of an elephant is two years.’

‘Huh?’

‘I thought we were playing a game,’ said Lerato, her voice floating on one of her wide smiles. ‘You know: you say a fact, I say a fact.’

I laughed. ‘You’re funny,’ I told her.

‘Laugh-a-minute Lerato, they call me,’ she said. ‘Listen, I’d love to stay and chat but I’ve got a funeral so I have to run and fetch cupcakes.’

‘Oh,’ I said, ‘I’m sorry. Who died?’

Lerato took a deep breath. ‘My mother’s cousin’s aunt on the other side’s brother-in-law.’

Lerato gets very upset when people call her a coconut. ‘How can I be a coconut when I go to all the funerals?’ she argues. And indeed, she does. But the thing with these funerals is that she’s supposed to take food – a bucket of scones seems to be the expected contribution. A few years ago, Lerato took a stand against tradition, and took fifty cupcakes instead. Her mother was mortified but the cupcakes went down very well with the younger crowd, and there was nearly a cat fight when her cousin Glory and her aunt Zanele reached for the last cupcake at the same time. So now Lerato takes about two hundred cupcakes, which costs her a fortune, even though the lady at The Patisserie gives her a discount. Once, Lerato and I made the cupcakes. It was a disaster, and Glory (Lerato and I call Glory ‘Glory Be’, and she’s rather a big woman who’s in no need of more baked goods) threatened to put sangoma muti on Lerato if she tried that again.

So that’s why I couldn’t talk more to Lerato, and when Sean came home, I didn’t have the heart to talk to him about his revolting parents because he was, as was becoming usual, a bit stressed out.

Sean and his business partner, Adam, had just left good jobs in IT to start up on their own. They invent apps for phones, and had already done some rather funky things. But they’d had a big contract with one of the banks that was suddenly looking shaky, and Sean was worried. Angela’s poison would have made him angry on top of it, which is a bad combination.

So instead, I’d tried to let him talk to me about work, use me as a sounding board, but Amy was all over the place, interrupting us every time we opened our mouths.

Sean raised his eyebrows at me. ‘Did she sleep this afternoon?’

I felt attacked. Our agreed strategy was to stop her sleeping in the day so that she fell asleep at night, but it wasn’t always possible. And frankly I needed the break too.

‘Leave her with Gugu,’ Sean said when I brought this up. He didn’t understand the terrible guilt I felt whenever I left her.

So I got defensive. ‘Yes, she slept,’ I said. ‘Want to try spending all day every day with a toddler and see how well *you* do with the no-sleep plan?’

It probably would have erupted into a full-on fight, but Amy distracted us by barrelling down the passage into Sean’s legs yelling, ‘Dada!’ The moment passed, and by the time she was asleep that evening, I was too tired to fight *or* to talk about Angela.

\*

The next day, the day of the playdate with Lilith, Rose cancelled.

I knew she felt bad, because she phoned me instead of texting. ‘Darling, I am so sorry,’ she said. ‘My goddam brother has arrived from London and I need to entertain him.’

‘I understand,’ I said, because that’s what I’ve been brought up to say, but the truth is that I didn’t understand at all. Surely she’d known that her brother was coming before that morning? I mean, surely that would have been a long-term arrangement? People don’t even pop in from down the road any more, let alone from London. In her shoes, I would never have agreed to the playdate in the first place, but people seem to do this type of thing the whole time these days, making me think that I’m the one in the wrong.

I sent Lilith a message saying, ‘Rose can’t make it this arvi. Raincheck if u prefer?’

But she answered almost immediately saying, ‘Fine just us. Looking fwd. ‘

I felt awful, because I was now dreading it more than ever. If Rose was there, then between her exuberant personality and her funny stories and all the children, the day would float. But Ruby and Amy were quieter children without Maggie, and somehow the idea of Lilith out of the context of the park made me anxious.

Lilith arrived exactly on time, driving her slightly battered old BMW up our long driveway. Probably the most personal thing that I knew about her was that her BMW was inherited from her father, who died before Ruby was born. I decided that, all else failing, I would at least use the afternoon as an opportunity to find out more about Lilith.

Once Lilith had unloaded Ruby from the car, she looked around her with an open curiosity that was so unusual it cheered me up. Normally, new people take in your home with scattered furtive glances, but Lilith looked around with her hands on her hips and her eyes so wide open you could see the whites all the way around.

‘This is *nice*,’ she said, decisively.

Ruby stood next to her and imitated her pose.

‘Thanks,’ I said. ‘Come in and see the rest.’

Lilith’s smile brought a fan of wrinkles to the translucent skin on her nose, and I thought not for the first time what a beautiful woman she was, but in an understated way.

‘I love seeing people’s houses,’ she said. ‘Especially now that I live in a flat. It’s lovely being reminded of the alternative.’

From anyone else that would have sounded bitter, but Lilith seemed so happy that it somehow felt like a real compliment. I would have expected to feel defensive after a statement like that, but something about Lilith made it okay. She took Ruby by the hand and we went inside.

As we walked into the house Amy appeared, almost panting with the effort of running down the passage to welcome Ruby, grabbed Ruby’s arm and yelled, ‘Come see Seraffy!’ Introducing her friend to her beloved Gugu seemed to be Amy’s first stop, and Ruby went along happily. For the first time since I’d met them, Lilith allowed Ruby out of her sight.

Across from the front door is a wall with passages leading off from either side, and I’ve filled the wall with family photos. The photos we’d had done professionally when Amy was a baby used to dominate, but I’d recently replaced most of them with canvases of newer family photos. In the middle was a lovely photo that my mom had taken of Sean, Amy and I.

Lilith peered at the wall.

‘I love that you have this at your entrance – a total celebration of your family,’ she said.

I felt a bit uncomfortable. The truth is, I’m never sure if it’s really, well, tasteful to have so many family photos so prominently displayed. I suppose part of this is my worry about Real Art, and the impression it makes when an artist has photos instead of a painting in pride of place.

‘Thanks,’ I said to Lilith, knowing she wasn’t judging me as I judged myself.

‘Who’s that?’ she asked, pointing at Sean. ‘Your brother?’

‘No,’ I laughed. ‘It’s my husband.’

Lilith looked completely confused. ‘But he’s white,’ she said. ‘Is Amy from a previous relationship?’

I took a moment to even understand what she meant.

‘Amy’s adopted,’ I said. ‘Surely you knew that?’

Lilith looked at me. ‘Oh God,’ she said, eventually. ‘You must think I’m so stupid. It never crossed my mind that she wasn’t your biological child. She looks like you, and sounds like you, and you two have such a clear bond.’

Intellectually, I knew that this mistake was possible. We’d been told that Amy’s biological mom was white, so it would have been perfectly logical for people to think she was my biological daughter. But I’d never actually spoken to anyone who’d made this mistake. I felt elated, freed from the bad feelings after my mom’s news of Angela. Lilith looked so embarrassed, a slow blush was creeping up her neck, and I spontaneously hugged her thin body to mine.

‘Thank you,’ I said. ‘I needed that.’

‘So tell me the story,’ said Lilith. ‘How did you come to adopt Amy?’

This was the magic of Lilith. From anyone else the question might have felt intrusive, but Lilith asked it with the same frank curiosity with which she’d surveyed my home and family photos. So as I made tea, I told her the story.

I told her about my endometriosis, and Sean’s low sperm count. I told her about the drugs, and then the four rounds of artificial insemination. I told her about the six unsuccessful IVF cycles, and all the little embryos we made that died when they were put back in my body. I told her about the lift of hope we felt with each new cycle, and the crushing defeat we felt with each failure. I told her how the money had run out and, more to the point, that so had our strength for the intrusive, pointless treatments.

I told her how we’d waited and waited for Amy after we’d applied to adopt, doing paperwork, and medical and psychological tests. I told her how we resented people who could just make a baby – and the fact that nobody worried about whether *they* would be good enough parents.

And then I told her about when we got Amy and how complete she made me, and Lilith lifted her cup of tea and said, ‘In celebration of Amy.’

I wiped away a tear that had escaped, and returned the toast. In celebration of Amy indeed.

‘So,’ said Lilith after we’d peeped in at the girls playing dolls on the floor of Amy’s room. They each had a doll that they were feeding and chatting happily to, ignoring each other for the most part. ‘So, will you be adopting another child?’

It was strange that she asked me this – a question that no one, not even my mom or Lerato, had asked. And strange that she should ask it then, so soon after Sean had brought up the subject.

‘We’ve talked about it,’ I said. ‘But Sean wants us to give IVF another try before we apply to adopt again.’

Lilith raised her eyebrows slightly, but said nothing.

‘He says it’s no reflection on Amy, but that he wants to give it another shot.’

‘Fair enough,’ said Lilith, but I didn’t agree. When Sean had suggested this to me, in his reasonable voice, I’d felt outraged on Amy’s behalf. I felt like he was rejecting her, and rejecting us as being Amy’s parents – the only identity that still mattered to me.

‘It’s not that at all,’ Sean had said, not getting angry despite my raised voice. ‘I just want to try again. You can paint a big Dog to pay for it, and you’re still young enough to have an easy pregnancy.’

‘Easy for you,’ I’d spat at him. ‘It’s not your body.’ Although for me the issue had never been the physical challenges of IVF, and Sean knew it.

‘Let’s do one cycle,’ he’d suggested. ‘Give me one cycle, and after that we can talk again.’

‘I think that makes sense,’ Lilith said now.

‘But what if it works?’ I voiced my secret fear. ‘What if we have a baby? What if Sean loves it more than he loves Amy?’ I dropped my voice, and somehow found the courage to ask the question that kept me awake the night before. ‘What if *I* love it more than Amy?’

Lilith laughed, and I felt momentarily affronted. Then she said, ‘Rebecca, I cannot imagine anyone loving any child more than you love Amy. And I think you know that in your heart.’ She took a sip of tea. ‘Anyway, from what I understand about having a second child, there’s always that risk. You might love a second adopted child more too.’

I thought about it, and realised she was right.

‘There are all sorts of variables,’ said Lilith. ‘Like, it might be a boy, and that would also be different.’

I nodded. True again.

‘If I were you,’ said Lilith, ‘I’d focus on the challenge that faces any mother of two. That you make them both feel special, and both feel loved.’ She looked at me, almost speculatively. ‘I think you can do that, Rebecca. I really do.’

And somehow, when she said it, I believed it.

It was only later that evening that I realised I hadn’t asked Lilith anything about herself.

Oh well, I thought, next time.

After that first visit from Lilith, something shifted in our group dynamic. Lilith felt like more a part of the group with Rose and me, and certainly from my point of view, she felt closer. I told Rose about Sean and the IVF, mostly because I felt a bit disloyal having shared this secret fear with Lilith only. Rose agreed with Lilith, and with the two of them urging me on, I told Sean that we could try another round of fertility treatment. Sean was so happy that for a moment I doubted my own wisdom: his very happiness felt like a betrayal of all we’d gone through to get Amy. But I bit my lip and made an appointment with the fertility gynae.

And then Lilith suggested that the three of us go for lunch.

‘Here’s my plan,’ she said one day at the park. ‘You guys bring your girls to my place, and we’ll leave them with Mrs Clarke, who often minds Ruby-Mae. She lives next door. And we’ll go up the road to Hyde Park for a quick lunch.’ Lilith looked at us, her blue eyes wide. ‘Please say yes. It’s been ages since I had a girls’ lunch. And I can enjoy it if I know that Ruby-Mae has friends with her.’

The lunch itself was no problem, but I must say the idea of leaving Amy with the unknown Mrs Clarke instead of Gugu freaked me out. I knew that Rose felt the same way. Thinking that I’d just make an excuse on the day, I cautiously agreed.

Lilith was delighted, and smiling wide she called to Ruby: ‘Ruby-Mae, Amy and Maggie are coming to play at our house.’

Ruby smiled, a mirror of her mother.

\*

On the day of the lunch date I fully intended cancelling the child care arrangements.

I’d decided that I’d pretend that Amy was sick, and therefore better at home with Gugu. I’d chatted to Rose, and she was going to use a visit from her mother as her excuse. I felt terrible – and terrible that little Ruby would be disappointed – but we really weren’t comfortable with the unknown Mrs Clarke, as much as Rose and I tried to convince each other that we were. I had even, feeling like I was totally transparent, planted the seed of my white lie the day before at the park: I mentioned to Lilith that I thought Amy was getting sniffly.

Gugu comes to work at 8am. She’s never late. So when she hadn’t come to work at eight-thirty on the day of the lunch date, I knew something was wrong.

I phoned her, to discover that she wasn’t feeling well, and intended going to the clinic. I was tempted to ask at what stage she’d actually planned on letting me know, but I bit my tongue. I know from experience that Gugu does not consider it her job to let me know when she is ill, but rather my job to ask, no matter how many times I tell her differently. I once even got Lerato to explain it all in Zulu, and Gugu nodded happily and said that yes, she could quite see. She still doesn’t phone though.

And so I had no child care on the one day – the *one* day – that I was counting on it. I phoned my mom in a state.

‘You have to look after Amy,’ I said.

‘I’d love to,’ said Mom. ‘When?’

‘Lunch today.’

My mother was silent. Then she said, ‘I have a pedicure.’

Now, when I was growing up, I don’t think my mother knew a pedicure from a peppercorn. Then my parents went away for a weekend a few years ago, and Mom had her first pedicure. She now has pedicures at least every two weeks. And they are sacred.

‘Surely you can reschedule?’ I said. ‘I’m desperate.’

‘Why?’ Mom sounded cautious.

I told her the story, a part of me already knowing what I was going to hear.

‘Mrs Clarke sounds lovely,’ said Mom. ‘I don’t know understand the problem.’

Given that I had described her as ‘an unknown quantity who is probably a paedophile’, my mom wasn’t exactly being rational. But I also know when I am beaten.

It was Mrs Clarke or Sean’s mom, and surely anyone was better than Angela Prince.

\*\*\*

When I arrived at the address Lilith had given me, I immediately had misgivings.

Her block of flats was particularly decrepit, with a row of shops underneath. There was an empty Italian restaurant, a cake shop and a laundry. But they were all dwarfed by the giant flashing neon sign saying: ‘Sexstuff. Adult shop.’ I’d driven past it a hundred times, wondering what sort of people lived in the flats above it.

Now I knew: Lilith. And Mrs Clarke.

I was considering just reversing out the small parking lot when Lilith stepped out of one of the first floor flats, and waved over the balcony, smiling.

I had no idea how I was going to leave Amy in a building with a sex shop. I knew rationally that the shop had nothing to do with Lilith, but the idea of Amy being anywhere near seedy types looking for porn on a weekday afternoon really bothered me. And for some reason, porn on a Tuesday afternoon seemed even less acceptable than, say, porn on a Saturday night. I was quite sure that the people in the shop at that very moment were a particularly pervy brand of perverts.

Still, Lilith looked so excited, so I smiled, and bundled Amy out of the car.

‘Look, Mommy, lights!’ Amy commanded happily, looking at the neon sign.

‘I’m so glad you made it,’ said Lilith as Amy and I reached the top of the stairs. ‘When you said Amy was feeling sick, I was worried you might cancel.’

I swear, until that moment, it had not crossed my mind that I could have just cancelled the whole lunch. I’d been so focused on Mrs Clarke and Amy that I somehow hadn’t seen that if I’d cancelled, the whole problem would have gone away. I was so angry with myself. But it was too late.

I smiled weakly at Lilith. ‘No,’ I said. ‘She rallied. We’re here.’

Lilith led me into the flat. ‘Well,’ she said. ‘Here it is. Home sweet home.’

I knew that my reaction mattered, and I looked around. The building was an old one, so the proportions of the flat were actually quite large and pleasing. The walls were painted in muted pastels, and Lilith had covered the somewhat ugly carpet with cheap, bright rugs. The walls were hung with posters and photos and some of Ruby’s art, which was displayed in supermarket picture frames.

‘It’s lovely,’ I said to Lilith. ‘You’ve really made it lovely.’

Lilith smiled. ‘Thank you,’ she said, squeezing my arm. ‘Home on a shoestring.’ She laughed, but it sounded a bit empty.

Just then, an enormous woman walked in through the flat’s open door. Her flesh billowed over a low-cut neckline, and her face was flushed with exertion. Her hair was bottle blonde, and held up with a scrunchy, and she actually had to turn her bulk sideways to get in the door.

No.

Lilith smiled. ‘Rebecca, this is Mrs Clarke.’

Yes.

Mrs Clarke smiled, revealing a smear of lipstick across her front teeth. ‘Nice to meet you,’ she said, her voice unexpectedly musical.

‘You too,’ I responded automatically, trying to take in her sheer bulk. Apparently my response was not enough, because nobody said anything. ‘So,’ I said, scraping my mind for social niceties. ‘So, you live in one of the flats?’

‘Next door,’ said Mrs Clarke. ‘Convenient for my shop.’

‘Mrs Clarke owns one of the shops downstairs,’ said Lilith, her voice light but her eyes fixed on mine.

I didn’t really have to ask, but at this point I tried to change reality.

‘The cake shop?’ I said hopefully, only realising as I said it that this might imply that I thought that she was fat. Which I did. Because she was.

Mrs Clarke laughed, her vast breasts quivering. ‘No. The sex shop.’

Lilith was still looking at me.

‘Ah,’ I said. ‘How ... nice.’

Just then, Amy tugged urgently at my hand. ‘Mommy,’ she said, ‘Mommy.’

‘Yes, love.’ I bent down, hoping to hide my confusion.

‘What’s a set shop?’

For a moment there was silence, and then both Mrs Clarke and I started laughing. Mrs Clarke left it for me to answer, and I liked that.

‘It’s a grown-up shop, sweetie,’ I said. ‘Very boring.’

‘Extremely boring,’ said Mrs Clarke, sounding as if she meant it. ‘Which is why I’m so happy to have three little girls to play with today. And where is my Ruby Ruby?’ she called, raising her voice.

To the right of the kitchen area was a passage, and Ruby came barrelling out. ‘Clarkie!’ she yelled. Then stopped and took in the scene. ‘Amy?’ She looked at her mom, a grin filling her pale face.

Lilith smiled at her daughter. ‘I told you, sweetie.’

Ruby seemed overcome with emotion. She sat down on the floor next to Lilith, as if unable to stand in the face of such bounty. And right then I was so glad that I hadn’t made an excuse, or cancelled.

I leant down to Ruby. ‘Amy’s been so excited to come, Ruby,’ I said. ‘She’s been so looking forward to seeing you and your house.’

I straightened, and looked at Lilith, who was about to speak when her cellphone, which she’d been holding, beeped. She glanced at it, frowning slightly.

‘It’s Rose,’ she said, reading a text. ‘She says she’ll meet us at the restaurant. Apparently her mom’s turned up out of the blue, so she’s leaving Maggie with her.’

I smiled and nodded, hoping it wasn’t obvious that I already knew about this plan. I nodded to Ruby, who was still sitting on the floor and smiling.

‘Just as well,’ I said. ‘If Maggie had arrived too, Ruby-Mae would probably have been too overcome to speak.’

We agreed to take my car, and we both said goodbye to our daughters – big hugs and kisses – and then to each other’s daughters – more hugs and kisses – and then to Mrs Clarke, who thankfully didn’t expect hugs and kisses.

‘Thanks, Eugenie,’ Lilith said to Mrs Clark as we left. ‘I really appreciate this.’

‘It’s nothing,’ said Eugenie Clark, sex-shop owner. ‘You deserve a break. Have a good lunch, girls.’

Lilith and I made small talk as we drove the short distance. I parked, squeezing in my car between a Land Rover and a pillar, and was about to open my door when Lilith reached for my arm. ‘Thank you,’ she said.

‘For what?’ I asked, genuinely confused.

‘For not judging Mrs Clarke. For bringing Amy to my flat. For trusting my judgment.’

I smiled. ‘I know you’re a great mom, Lilith,’ I said. ‘If you trust Mrs Clarke with Ruby-Mae, then I know Amy will be safe with her too.’ Having said this, I realised the truth of my words, and wondered why I had ever worried. Then I laughed. ‘Although maybe you should have warned me about her shop!’

# Good mothers are good listeners.

---

Rose was waiting for us at the restaurant, fiddling with her phone as if it contained all the secrets of the universe if only she could push the right button. She stood up when she saw us, and we spent a confused few minutes greeting each other and deciding who would sit where – hardly brain surgery as there were only three of us, but somehow it seemed important. It always strikes me as strange, the greetings of women. At the park, Rose, Lilith and I would never hug or kiss, and at the flat, Lilith and I had not embraced, but now we both kissed Rose on the cheek before we sat down, Lilith in the middle, Rose and I across from each other.

Rose launched into a detailed story about her unexpected visit from her mother and having to leave Maggie behind, and from the way that Lilith nodded, I knew she knew Rose was lying. And then Rose cottoned on that Amy was with Ruby and Mrs Clarke, and gave me such a startled look that I was sure Lilith would pick up that I’d also planned to leave Amy at home. I wanted to just melt into my rather hard designer chair. Instead, I glued a gormless smile to my face and tried not to look guilty.

As Rose’s explanation finally petered out, there was an awkward moment where nobody had anything to say, but then the waiter saved us and we ordered wine, feeling (at least in my case) like a naughty schoolgirl. I told the others this, and it broke the tension, and then we started trading the usual stories about our week of parenting. Rose told a story about some thoughtless parenting action of the husband of a friend of hers, and I topped it with a story about how I’d asked Sean to buy nappies on his way home, and not only had he not known what size Amy wears, but he’d also not known what brand we use.

‘How can he be so oblivious?’ I demanded of my friends, taking a huge swig of wine.

Rose nodded sympathetically, but Lilith said, ‘At least he bought the nappies.’

That stopped us. Because although we knew that Lilith was a single mom, neither of us had the least idea why. And here was our chance. I knew Rose well enough to know that she was searching for the right words to ask, and I left it to her, knowing that I’d make a hash of it if I tried. Lilith saved us both the embarrassment.

‘I’m sure you’ve wondered about Ruby-Mae’s father,’ she said.

There’s no right answer. ‘Yes’ and you sound nosy; ‘no’ and you sound uncaring. We both made neutral noises and busied ourselves with invisible fluff on the table cloth.

Lilith took a sip of her wine, and the waiter arrived with our food. I was petrified that the distraction would stop her telling us, but it almost seemed like she was determined to get the story out. It was as if, for Lilith, this was the whole point of our lunch. In retrospect, maybe it was.

‘You must understand,’ she started. She put her fork into her penne as if to eat, but then abandoned it there. ‘He was a bad man. That’s the most important thing for you to understand.’

As she spoke, she unthinkingly rubbed a crescent-shaped scar that I’d often noticed on her arm. This was the first time I’d seen her touch it.

‘At the beginning, he seemed very charming,’ she said. ‘If he walked in and sat down with us now, you’d find him lovely. At least for a bit. And good-looking.’ She smiled at the memory. ‘Very good-looking, I’ll give him that.’ She sighed, and carried on. ‘I grew up in Durban, but I moved to Port Elizabeth and I didn’t know many people there, and I was working too hard to make many friends. My parents were killed in a car accident about a month before I met him, and I was feeling very alone.’

Rose and I made sympathetic sounds. I knew her father had died, but nothing about her mother, and I found myself wondering if the old BMW was the car that they’d died in. I could easily have got sidetracked, but Lilith waved aside our sympathetic noises and half-formed questions.

‘I was working in a big gallery when I met Ron, just as a receptionist. He used to come in whenever he had a break, and look at the art, and tell me how one day he was going to be a player, a rich guy, someone who owned good paintings. He seemed like a guy with a plan, with a vision.’ Lilith paused and sipped her wine. ‘I guess I was a classic victim. No parents, an only child, a few friends who were easily shaken off. Ron saw me coming.’

Rose looked as if she was about to interrupt, and I held my breath, willing her not to break the flow. But she just said, ‘Oh dear,’ and Lilith continued.

‘What makes me angry is that he wasn’t even rich or powerful, like abusive men in books. I didn’t stay for his money, or because he had friends who’d hurt me if I left, or because he was clever enough to track me down. I just stayed because I was a fool.’

‘You were vulnerable,’ said Rose, and I wished I was like her, that I could find the right thing to say in a situation like this.

‘On one level I know that,’ said Lilith. ‘But it’s pathetic. I have no patience with women who act like I did.’

We were silent for a moment, and then she shrugged.

‘The day I found out I was pregnant I felt completely trapped. I knew I couldn’t bring a baby into the violence that was my life, but I didn’t know if I’d find the strength to leave. I thought maybe I’d just quietly have an abortion.’ She looked down at her hands for a moment, and Rose was about to speak, but I reached out and touched her arm, giving a small shake of my head.

‘Ron worked as a waiter – he was actually very good at it, with his looks and charm. But he hated it, hated people telling him what to do. Hated that people would spend on their lunch what he sometimes earned in a day. The worse his day, the worse he treated me.’ She sighed. ‘He must have had a really bad day that day, because no sooner was he through the door than he started attacking me. All I could think was that I had to protect the baby, so I curled into a little ball to protect my stomach, and I concentrated on not passing out. Eventually, he stopped and left.’

Lilith rubbed the scar on her arm again.

‘I had no one to call. Nowhere to go. So I crawled to the phone and called an ambulance, just before I passed out.’ She took a deep breath, and looked at us. ‘I got better. I came to Johannesburg. I made a new life. And, thank God, Ruby-Mae was unharmed. I know he’s out there somewhere, looking for me. But he’s not rich, and he’s not smart. It’s not like in the movies. I don’t think he’ll find me.’

I wasn’t sure who she was trying to convince, herself or us. But I took her hand and squeezed it. ‘You’re so brave,’ I said. ‘You saved your daughter.’

‘I guess I did,’ said Lilith. ‘Now I just have to make sure that I can keep saving her.’

‘You do,’ said Rose. ‘Every day.’

Lilith smiled. ‘I guess I do,’ she said, but her voice sounded empty. She took a deep breath. ‘Anyhow,’ she said, her voice falsely bright, ‘I just wanted you guys to know the story. And to understand that there’s no situation on earth that would make Ruby-Mae’s father a positive thing in her life.’

‘Lilith,’ I said, ‘we would never suggest that you let Ruby-Mae spend time with a man like that. Sometimes no father is better than a bad father.’

‘Is Sean a good father?’ asked Lilith, and I was quite taken aback by her forthrightness. But I told myself that she’d just shared a part of her life, so maybe the usual boundaries had fallen away.

‘He’s an excellent father,’ I said, choosing my words carefully. ‘Some men struggle with adoption, but Sean hasn’t. He’s not a perfect husband,’ I added, with a nervous laugh. ‘Although from what you’ve just said, maybe I should count my blessings.’

‘What’s wrong with him as a husband?’ asked Lilith, and I could see that Rose was feeling slightly awkward – probably wondering what confidences she’d be asked to share, and how she would sidetrack the conversation.

I felt disloyal saying anything bad about Sean, although I’d been dissing him minutes before. Maybe I felt a bit foolish after Lilith’s story.

‘Oh, the usual,’ I said. ‘His life has carried on after Amy. Mine hasn’t. And now this new go at IVF, but not a thought to helping me a bit more.’ My voice had risen slightly, and I consciously dropped it. ‘Lilith, it sounds so petty. He’s a good man, really. A good husband.’

‘What’s good about him?’ she said.

I shrugged. ‘He’s funny,’ I ventured, ‘and kind.’ I smiled. ‘And clever. And ambitious. And supportive. ‘ I was suddenly feeling rather fond of my husband, and probably could have gone on spelling out his virtues now that Lilith’s story had put things into perspective.

‘And Aidan?’ said Lilith, turning to Rose. ‘Is Aidan a good husband?’

‘Aidan’s fine,’ said Rose. ‘Much like Sean, I guess. Good enough.’ She laughed as if she’d said something funny, then stopped. ‘Aidan’s fine,’ she repeated. Something about her voice told us that the topic was closed, and I desperately searched my mind for something to change the subject to. But Lilith seemed prepared.

‘So,’ she said, leaning forward, ‘do either of you have the name of a good swimming school?’

The conversation segued easily from swimming schools to other children’s activities. Lilith mentioned her job as a doctor’s receptionist, which allowed her to send Ruby-Mae to crèche in the morning, and spend afternoons at home with her. I talked a bit about my work, and the challenges of painting and mothering, because I can’t disappear into a painting like I used to. Rose told us that she was a trained beautician – which I found unexpected. Not because she isn’t beautiful, but because I’d somehow presumed that she’d studied something quite cerebral – I had English Literature in my head for some reason. I said so, and for a moment I couldn’t tell if the comment pleased Rose or offended her. But she laughed, and the conversation moved on.

Still, by the time I picked up a tired but happy Amy, I felt exhausted – and a bit like I’d spent the morning in the headmistress’s office – although I couldn’t put my finger on why.

# Good mothers work on their marriages.

---

---

Lunch with Rose and Lilith, and the strange conversation about husbands and Ruby-Mae’s father, left me thinking about Sean. About what it was that had led us to the place we were: where we’d embarked on a new course of fertility treatment that was making me feel violated, and I couldn’t find the words to tell him.

I met Sean at my first Dog Show – the one Joanne had arranged after she’d sold the first few works. I’d been vaguely dating an engineer called Martin before that, but it wasn’t particularly intense and when I’d knuckled down to produce the fifty works Joanne had demanded of me, the relationship petered out. I don’t think Martin was particularly bereft, and I certainly wasn’t. I was completely focused on my first major show, and elated when I actually achieved the output.

On the day of the opening, Joanne and Trixie (her partner, both in business and in life) had rushed around the gallery trying to decide which works to hang, stopping occasionally to make pronouncements about my talent. This was especially gratifying from Trixie, who is a formidably elegant and initially cold Japanese woman who had never deigned to speak to me before. Suddenly, while lifting a small, framed purple dachshund frolicking in some daffodils, Trixie stopped dead in her tracks. She put the painting down and turned towards me, a finger on her cheek. She contemplated me much as she’d just contemplated the paintings that were hanging on the wall.

‘Joanne,’ she suddenly hollered, although she didn’t wait for a response. ‘Sending Rebecca to Jonas. Is only answer.’

Joanne looked up from the painting she’d been eyeing and pushed her blonde hair back from her eyes. ‘Okay, sweetheart,’ she said.

I always found the word ‘sweetheart’ a bit hard to swallow in the context of someone as scary as Trixie. If she was my life partner, I’d probably call her Sergeant-Major.

Trixie took her phone out of her pocket, and keyed in a single number – whoever it was was obviously on speed dial. I glanced at Joanne for an explanation, but Trixie started yelling at her phone in what I presumed was Japanese, and Joanne wandered into another room. To be honest, I was too afraid of Trixie to move. The only bit of the conversation I understood was when Trixie yelled, ‘Full works. Emergency.’

Apparently that got her what she wanted, because she soon hung up and scribbled an address on a piece of paper.

‘Jonas is waiting,’ she said, in her usual clipped voice. To this day I’m not sure if it is an accent, or just how she speaks. I was about to ask her for more information, when she yelled, ‘Go. Go. Jonas will not wait forever.’

So I left, with absolutely no idea of what to expect, and obediently drove myself to the address on the paper. To my relief it turned out to be a beauty salon and not one of the many more colourful things I’d been imagining.

I presented myself at the reception desk, and as soon as I muttered, ‘I’m Rebecca. Jonas is expecting me, I think,’ a flurry of Japanese women appeared from behind a screen and, clucking like excited hens, led me through a door. They sat me down in front of a mirror and disappeared, and I was briefly alone in a large room, which contained only a full-length mirror, my chair and, hanging from the ceiling, an empty bamboo bird cage.

I wondered if I should be offended that I’d been found so wanting, but the truth is, compared to Trixie, I clearly was. After just enough time had passed to make me feel really uncomfortable, a small Japanese man emerged from one of the three doors leading off the room.

‘Hi,’ I said brightly.

He just shook his head sadly, looking me up and down. Then he came a bit closer and touched my hair like you might touch a dead thing left on your doormat by a cat.

‘Bad, bad hair,’ he muttered. ‘Bad.’ He sighed deeply, and reached for his phone. ‘Trixie!’ he yelled, and launched into Japanese, presumably to tell Trixie the extent of the unacceptability of my hair, and possibly my whole self. Or perhaps he was angry with Trixie for introducing such horror into his life. Either way, he was clearly a very brave man, shouting at Trixie like that.

I just sat there, feeling strangely passive about the process.

Eventually, the man I presumed to be Jonas hung up, and sighed again. ‘Rebecca,’ he said, ‘this is bad, bad hair.’

‘I’m sorry,’ I ventured.

‘But I will do my best. Because you are friend of Trixie. And she is very great woman.’

‘Ah,’ I said, unable to agree that I was indeed a friend of Trixie’s, or that she was a great woman.

‘Trixie says that you too are very great woman.’ Jonas sighed. ‘With bad, bad hair.’ He glanced at me. ‘And I can’t even talk about your eyebrows. It is too painful for me.’ He placed his hand over his heart to indicate the source of his pain.

We both contemplated my bad hair and eyebrows in the mirror for a moment, and then Jonas clapped his hands twice, hard. The women who had led me to the room reappeared, twittering amongst themselves.

‘Prepare her,’ Jonas said, waving his hand towards me, and left again.

Strangely, despite the bad, bad hair and the eyebrows that caused Jonas such pain, the rest of the afternoon passed extremely pleasantly. I was massaged, my hair was washed, I was given a manicure and a pedicure, my make-up was tastefully done and, of course, Jonas tamed my bad, bad hair into what he described as, ‘Better. Obedient hair.’ Most bizarrely, an outfit was produced from behind a door. An outfit that I expected to hate but which was, in fact, so exactly me that I was speechless: flowing black pants, and a silky top with a motif of tiny butterflies, and a neckline that showed off my cleavage. I looked lovely – a svelte Japanese version of my usual uncontained self.

When I got back to the gallery, Joanne clapped her hands and said that I looked lovely. Trixie looked me up and down, and nodded. ‘Better,’ she said. High praise.

My makeover gave me new courage and a new persona. At the opening, I greeted my friends more effusively, gesturing with my perfectly manicured hands as I spoke. I laughed a bit louder, and drank more than usual from martini glasses filled with unusual-coloured liquids. It was my night, and it felt like it. And at the end of the night, eighty per cent of the paintings had red ‘sold’ stickers on them, and the remaining paintings sold over the course of the next three days. Joanne declared it their most successful exhibition ever, and Trixie said, ‘Was nice.’

And in the middle of that magical night, I met Sean. My brother, Carl, had brought a big group of his friends, most of whom I already knew. They all gushed about my new look in a most satisfactory way, and flirted with me as if I was the prize of the evening. I *was* the prize of the evening. But one man held back, sipping a glass of red wine and looking quietly at the pictures.

There was something about him that immediately attracted me. It sounds awful to say, but it related to how normal he looked, how sound. He was perhaps a bit taller than most men (six foot two inches, I later learnt) and a bit better looking than most men, with his sandy hair and wide smile, and brown eyes that sparkled. But he wasn’t *too* tall, or *too* good-looking. He was a man who looked real – not too good to be true.

I watched him for a bit, waiting for him to look at me, but he didn’t. He looked at the paintings, and then chatted to a few of his friends who weren’t swarming around me, having handed that baton to others. I grabbed my brother’s sleeve.

‘Carl, who is that?’ I asked.

Carl looked. ‘He’s a friend of Grant’s. Sam, I think. Or maybe Patrick.’

‘Sam or Patrick?’ I said. ‘How the hell are those two names similar?’

Carl shrugged. ‘Never said they were.’ My brother can be infuriating.

‘Introduce me,’ I said.

Carl looked at me like I was bats. ‘I can’t introduce you. I don’t know his name.’

So I did it myself. I walked over to him, and his friends seemed to sense something and wondered off. ‘Hi,’ I said, ‘I’m Rebecca.’

He smiled, and I caught a glimpse of the way his face would age – all laugh lines and dimples.

‘I know,’ he said. ‘You’re the very talented lady of the moment.’

‘Yes,’ I said, because in my Japanese-chic persona, I could accept compliments; the real Rebecca is completely tongue tied by the merest hint of one.

‘I’m Sean,’ he said, holding out his hand for me to shake.

I took it. ‘Neither Sam nor Patrick,’ I said.

He must have thought I was totally nuts, or maybe that this was artist talk, because he barely batted an eyelid. ‘Neither Sam nor Patrick,’ he said. ‘I hope you won’t hold that against me.’

I’m not a flirty type of woman. I don’t come up with clever lines, or come on to strange men. But to Sean Prince, on the night of my sell-out opening, I said, rather saucily, ‘I won’t hold that ... against you.’

And after a few more rounds of the room, and a few more drinks, I went home with him, thinking I was having the first one-night stand of my life. No good should come of a relationship started with such wanton and clichéd behaviour.

Instead, two years later, when I was twenty-eight and he was thirty-two, I married him.

On the day I had lunch with Lilith, I thought about the Sean I had fallen in love with: the way he can have fun, but approaches life with a sensible edge; the way he never goes into debt, but can still spend money freely; the way he laughs, but is never insensitive; the way he approaches life with both questions and answers. And I recognised that, like so many wives through time, the very things I loved were starting to drive me mad. If I complained about a day with Amy, he suggested I leave her with Gugu and have a day to myself. He’d say it in a calculatedly calm voice, like you’d use to someone standing on a ledge: ‘Come off that ledge, Rebecca, let’s talk it out’.

Sometimes those days, because it felt like I *was* standing on a ledge, well, Sean’s calm voice could have made me jump. Because I heard what I hadn’t before – a certain level of judgement; a belief in his own sensibleness. What at the beginning seemed calm and reliable now sometimes sounded like a constant barrage of ‘I know better’.

I thought about what Lilith had told Rose and me, and I felt bad. Lilith had been with a man who would have pushed her off the ledge, so how could I complain about my lovely, calm and sensible husband?

I decided I would talk to him again, appeal to the lovely man I married, and try to make him see how angry this new attempt at IVF – which we hadn’t even started yet – had made me feel.

\*

I made us a nice supper, putting in more effort than I had lately. Over oxtail, I brought up the subject.

‘Sean,’ I said, ‘I’m not really feeling happy about this decision to try IVF again.’

Sean put down his fork. ‘I thought we’d agreed,’ he said in his Rebecca’s-on-the-ledge voice. ‘I thought this decision was made.’

‘It was. But I’m not happy about the decision we’ve made, and I want us to talk about it some more.’

‘Well, Rebecca,’ he said, ‘what would you like to do?’

I ignored his tone, trying hard to respond rationally.

‘I’d like us to start adoption proceedings again. I want to adopt another child.’

Sean steepled his fingers – a sure sign that he believed what he was about to say was eminently sensible.

‘All I am asking is for us to try one more cycle of IVF,’ he said. ‘After that, if it doesn’t work, we go back to adoption.’ He leant forward. ‘We can even start the adoption process at the same time.’

‘I just don’t understand,’ I blurted out. ‘Don’t you love Amy?’

Sean backed away like I’d slapped him. ‘How can you ask me that? I love you and Amy more than anything, anything, in the world.’

‘Then why do you want to try for ...’ I stopped myself. I had been about to say ‘our own baby’. But Sean obviously understood me.

He looked at his plate and breathed out. ‘This is going to sound stupid,’ he said.

‘Try me.’

‘I feel like if we adopt another child, we’ll take something away from the special way we got Amy,’ he said. ‘But if we give birth to this one, then they’ll both be special.’ He stopped, and looked at me. ‘I told you it was stupid.’

‘No,’ I said. ‘It’s ...’ I searched for the right words, his motives recalibrating in my brain. ‘It’s actually rather lovely.’ I reached for his hand. ‘*You’re* actually rather lovely.’

‘So can we try?’ he said.

I nodded. ‘I guess we can.’ I paused. ‘But if it doesn’t work the first time, I get to decide if we try again.’

‘Totally,’ agreed Sean, and we went back to our supper, and I told him a bit about my lunch with the girls, including Lilith’s terrible story.

I made an appointment at the fertility clinic the next morning.

\*

Dr Stevenson greeted me warmly, as if it hadn’t been more than three years since he’d last seen me. Not for the first time, I thought about how useful doctors’ files must be in helping them act like they remember their patients.

I explained the situation to Dr Stevenson, and he seemed enthusiastic about us trying again, saying that often variables change with the passing of time, and that couples who have struggled can suddenly react better to fertility treatment. We established that, counting from my last cycle, I was on about day twelve of my cycle, and that if it was a healthy cycle, my egg should be almost ready to release.

‘Hop on the table,’ said Dr Stevenson – words I’d heard him say so often in the past. ‘Let’s take a look.’

One of the things that happens when you have fertility treatment is that you lose any squeamishness about gynaecological examinations. I thought maybe I would find it strange after the time that had passed, but as Dr Stevenson slid the incongruous condom over the scanner, it felt like just yesterday that I’d last had this scan.

‘Your ovaries look good,’ Dr Stevenson said a few minutes later. ‘One has a great, healthy egg growing in it. The other looks healthy – no cysts. Your lining is also looking great.’ He smiled, and finished the scan. ‘Get dressed, and let’s chat.’

Back at his desk, he was flipping through my file.

‘Here’s my idea, Rebecca,’ he said as I sat down. ‘That egg looks so great, and obviously this cycle is far too far along to do IVF. So I’d like to try artificial insemination during this cycle. It’s probably a long shot, but let’s try. If it doesn’t work, then I suggest we do an IVF cycle.’

I hadn’t really expected to move so quickly. ‘When would we do the AI?’ I asked, slipping into the jargon like an old cardigan.

‘You’d come in for an injection first thing tomorrow, to make sure the egg releases, and then you and Sean would need to come in with a fresh sperm sample the next day.’

‘That’s quick,’ I said.

‘I know,’ said Dr Stevenson. ‘You don’t have to, of course. But what’s the harm?’

‘Eight grand?’ I said, and Dr Stevenson had the grace to look embarrassed.

I felt bad. The money wasn’t really a problem. My low work output ironically meant that when I did paint a Dog, they sold for even more. One big painting would sort out this whole process.

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Let’s do it.’

I left the clinic feeling slightly overwhelmed, and a bit ambushed. But underneath that, I felt something else. Something I hadn’t really expected.

I felt excited.

# Good mothers have birthday parties.

Around the time that we started fertility treatment again, it seemed to be birthday party season for me and my park friends, although as the weather got colder we were spending less time at the park, and more time at Rose and my homes. We’d had tea at Lilith’s flat, but the three girls had found it a bit cramped, and Lilith had reluctantly suggested that maybe she shouldn’t try to play host. Instead, she often bought a cake or sweetly iced cupcakes that she got at cost from the shop downstairs, because they weren’t perfect enough for some child’s party. The girls loved that – seeing the different things they could get. Barney one week, flowers the next.

Amy’s birthday is at the beginning of May – in fact, we love the conceit of having her name an anagram of the word ‘May’. Ruby-Mae is at the end of May and it turned out that her birth month had also played a part in her name. And then Maggie is towards the end of June, and Lilith and I teased Rose that Maggie’s name should have been June. She laughed, but seemed a bit offended at the same time, and said that month names were ‘stupid’, apparently without realising she might be offending us.

For Amy’s first birthday we’d invited everybody we knew – everybody in the world, it felt like – and we’d had an enormous lunch party with a jumping castle and a lamb on the spit.

‘I suppose it’s really more a celebration for us,’ I’d said to my mom over Amy’s sleeping head at the party.

‘No kidding,’ my mom had agreed, looking around.

I’d gone to the other extreme for Amy’s second birthday: it was just us and family. Carl came, and Sean’s sister, Susan. My parents, of course. We invited the Princes, but they had a ‘pre-existing arrangement’. On their granddaughter’s birthday. Anyway, Amy was actually awake this party, and enjoyed it, and her presents. I slightly regretted making it so low key.

And now she was turning three. My down-haired chocolate angel was now a great big three year old who was so excited about her birthday. This year, I’d decided to make it all about the children. I suppose this seems self-evident to lots of people, but I know I hadn’t been alone in getting my own needs confused with those of my child when it came to birthday parties.

So I spoke to my friends, and especially Rose and Lilith, about different ideas, and the things we thought toddlers enjoyed most, and the most successful and unsuccessful parties we’d been to. Lilith was the only one who had a child at crèche, so she’d already been to a whole variety of parties, and was an amazing source of ideas. Eventually, at her suggestion, I settled on the ubiquitous jumping castle, and a mobile farmyard with bunnies. Amy asked for a Hello Kitty cake, so I made the whole thing a Hello Kitty theme, and ran myself ragged looking for Hello Kitty party plates and banners and party packs and favours.

‘It’s a three year old’s party,’ said Sean mildly, after I’d spent half an hour telling him how hard it was to find Hello Kitty serviettes. ‘And anyway, shouldn’t you be taking it easy?’

We’d done the AI and were now in the waiting period – two weeks before I could do a pregnancy test.

‘Dr Stevenson said to carry on as usual,’ I said, feeling defensive.

‘You don’t usually drive yourself mad organising the party of the century,’ Sean said, but he laughed as he said it, and I felt better.

‘I don’t usually have a daughter turning three,’ I countered.

We smiled at each other. ‘Three,’ he said. ‘Seems like just yesterday we got her. What a happy day.’

‘Let’s celebrate that day too,’ I suddenly said.

‘You want to have a party on her birthday and then three months later on the day we got her?’ asked Sean, his brow furrowed.

I laughed. ‘No,’ I said. ‘I’m not that nuts. But let’s, as a family, mark that day too. It’ll make her aware of her adoption as a positive thing, and as part of our lives.’

Sean thought for a moment. ‘Cool,’ he said. ‘I guess in a way that’s really the day that changed our lives.’

For a moment I was back there, at the foster home, finally being allowed to take the baby that I had been visiting for three weeks home with me, finally being allowed to believe she was mine. I looked at Sean, and I could see that he was also reliving it. We smiled, and squeezed hands.

The party list was a challenge though. I’d been determined that we’d only invite people who actually meant something to Amy – adults who were involved with her often, or children that we played with. Still, in the end, there were about twenty-five children of various ages coming and about thirty adults.

‘Fucking circus,’ Sean said mildly when I told him the figures.

‘Not a circus,’ I countered. ‘I haven’t asked your parents.’

‘Very funny,’ said Sean.

Bizarrely, a week before Amy’s birthday, and the day before I was due to do a pregnancy test, Angela phoned Sean. It was after eight, and I was sitting on the couch next to him, reading.

‘Are you doing anything for Amy’s birthday?’ she apparently asked.

‘Yes.’ Sean didn’t volunteer anything more.

‘Well, you and Rebecca seemed angry when we couldn’t come last year, so we thought we’d check in advance this year.’

‘A week is hardly advance,’ Sean said, although he told me that up till that point he’d been quite touched that his mother had actually remembered Amy’s birthday, and that she wanted to be included. She’d promptly ruined the moment by saying that she thought Amy’s birthday was in June.

‘It’s so hard to remember because she wasn’t actually born,’ Angela Prince had apparently observed.

Sean put the phone down and turned to me. ‘You know what, Rebecca?’ he said.

‘What?’

‘I think I might be done with those people.’

‘What people?’

‘My parents.’

‘Even if we find out tomorrow that we’ve made them a ‘real’ grandchild?’ I gestured the apostrophes in the air.

‘They *have* a real grandchild,’ said Sean. ‘If they’re too stupid to see that, I don’t want them to be part of *any* of our children’s lives.’

I hugged him, feeling a small sense of relief that Angela wouldn’t be at Amy’s party, and a large sense of relief that she might actually be out of my life for real.

\*\*\*

The next morning I woke up early – before Amy, which was almost physically impossible back then. I felt the weight of all Sean’s hopes settle in my stomach as I took out the home pregnancy test I’d bought in preparation for this moment. Regardless of the result, I had to go into the clinic for a blood test that morning, but experience had taught me that it was better to do the home test first and be prepared for the worst.

The instructions say that you should pee on the stick, but despite the numerous tests I’ve done, I can never get that right. Instead, I peed into a container filched from the gynae’s rooms for this purpose, and I stuck the papery end of the test into my yellow morning urine. Once I saw that the test window was wet, I placed the test flat on the floor and closed my eyes.

You have to wait three minutes, and I counted. I counted to one hundred and eighty slowly, and then opened my eyes.

There was only one line. Negative.

Sean was waiting outside the door.

‘And?’ he said. I shook my head slightly, trying hard not to loosen the tears I was holding back. ‘Could be too early for a home test to work?’ he said, with a questioning lilt.

He was right – it could. But I knew that it wasn’t. I wasn’t pregnant, and I felt like a fool for even allowing myself to hope.

Sean came with me to the clinic anyway, and sat through the wait for the blood test – remarkably quick, but it still felt like hours. And when the test came back negative, he held my hand and said, ‘It’s okay, we tried. We don’t have to do the IVF as well.’

Three weeks before, I would have said that this was all I wanted to hear. But something had shifted.

‘No,’ I said. ‘I want to try the IVF again. This was just a shot in the dark – the IVF will be a proper try.’

In his room a bit later, Dr Stevenson was disappointed for us, but admitted that with our history, an AI was unlikely to have worked. ‘But stranger things have happened,’ he said before I could ask why he’d made us go through a process that was expensive and pointless. We told him that we wanted to do the IVF, and he smiled and said, ‘No time like the present – let’s start this cycle.’

We agreed, somewhat cautiously on my part, and he took me through the IVF procedures again. Sean and I then went together to collect the bag of drugs and injections from the clinic pharmacy. Despite the disappointment I felt at not being pregnant, I was filled with a sudden and unexpected optimism.

\*\*\*

The day of Amy’s party was one of those perfect early-winter days that you only get in Joburg. The morning bite of cold gave way to a clear-skied, sunny day that was warm enough for the children to play happily outside. Not for the first time I thought how glad I was that we’d never given in to the temptation to emigrate away from Joburg’s challenges, and that we could still count the Highveld weather as one of our blessings.

Amy’s party was enormous and overwhelming – full of screaming, sugar-high children and talking, drinking, eating parents. It was only a few hours, but at one point I thought it would never end. At about that moment, I glanced over to where Lilith was standing watching Ruby. Ruby was playing with the bunnies, and Lilith was sipping a glass of orange juice, her eyes focused on her daughter, but not really seeing her. There was something far away about her expression, as if she was somewhere far sadder than a three year old’s party. At the time, I wondered if she was thinking about her dead parents and Ruby’s father, as my parents and husband were so much in evidence. I also wondered if she was comparing what we had given Amy to what she could offer Ruby.

The other thing I remember about Lilith that day is how long she spent speaking to Sean. They’d met before that, briefly, but that was the first time she’d had a chance to really talk to him. And she’d certainly done that, almost cornering him, asking him question after question about himself. I had a moment of wondering if she might actually be coming on to him – she was, after all, a single woman, and Sean is an attractive man. Perhaps she’d decided that I didn’t appreciate him and that he deserved a better wife. I allowed the idea to float briefly, but then mentally chastised myself. Lilith simply wasn’t that type of woman. And if she was looking for a husband, there were several single dads at the party who would surely have been simpler options.

‘She’s nice,’ Sean said cautiously after the party, while he and I cleared up, helped by Lerato, who’d popped in at the end. ‘But she’s a bit intense.’ He paused, searching for the right words. ‘I felt a bit like I was being interviewed for a job. A really hectic job.’

‘She is a bit like that,’ I agreed, thinking of how I’d felt when I first met her. ‘Nosy, but in a kind of lovely way.’

‘She’s nuts,’ Lerato said with a dismissive wave of her hand.

‘You barely spoke to her,’ I argued. ‘Plus, you never like anybody.’

‘S’true I never like anybody,’ said Lerato. ‘But I did speak to her. And she’s nuts.’ I was about to say something but Lerato carried on. ‘Loves her child though,’ she said, as if this was an unusual and not quite understandable emotion. ‘And she seemed very pleased that I’m a lawyer. Said you were lucky to have a friend who’s a lawyer. So maybe she’s not completely nuts.’

‘She’d change her mind if she knew what a grumpy-assed lawyer my friend is,’ I said, giving Lerato a look. ‘Although I concede,’ I added, leaning against her, ‘that I *am* lucky to have you.’

Ruby-Mae’s party two weeks later was a contrast to Amy’s, although not in the way that I had expected. Lilith spent a great deal of money on it – more, I’ll be honest, than I would have thought she could afford.

She rented the party room at the kids’ art space down the road from her – a place I love in theory, but find too pricey in practice. The room was beautifully decorated and the children were given quite complicated art projects to do: too complicated for three year olds, but they had fun covering themselves and their surroundings in glitter. The cake came from the shop downstairs from her, and she confided in me that they’d done it for free. It was exceptional: a cake in the shape of a fairy, with intricate icing and little sugar flowers all over it. Around the base it said, ‘Happy 3rd birthday Fairy Princess Ruby-Mae!’, and the dots of the ‘i’s were tiny flowers. Amy gasped with pleasure when she saw it.

But the party showed us more clearly than anything else how small Lilith’s world was. Of course, Rose and I knew that Lilith had no family – but it really came home to both of us quite how alone Lilith and Ruby-Mae were. Lilith had decided not to invite all the children from Ruby-Mae’s crèche.

‘I only want the people who matter to her,’ Lilith had said, echoing my own plans, but applying it much more strictly.

So it was Rose and me and our girls, and one child from crèche, who was Ruby-Mae’s best friend there. The mother seemed nice, but she kept her distance from Rose and me, regarding us, I thought, with deep suspicion. Mrs Clarke was there in her enormous glory, and a little girl called Amelia, who turned out to be the child of one of the cleaners at the downstairs bakery. Ruby-Mae and Amelia often played together, and Amelia was a sweet little thing. But that was all. These were all the people who were important to Ruby-Mae, and it broke my heart.

Amy was particularly taken with Amelia. She wrapped her arms around her and squeezed her, and touched her hair. She abandoned her usual pursuit of Maggie and Ruby in favour of following Amelia around the room, and trying to copy whatever she did. Eventually Amy sidled over to me, and pulled me down to her level.

‘Mommy,’ she said in my ear, her face tangling in my wild hair. ‘Mom, that girl is brown like me.’

It was the first time Amy had said anything about being a different colour, and it upset me because I knew it was the first step on a long and complicated path. I also knew that my job as her mother was to make that path as smooth as possible, so I smiled and said, ‘Yes. Beautiful and brown, just like you.’ I waited for her to say more, to ask more questions, but she just nodded, and went back to Amelia.

Lilith seemed a bit put out by Amy’s interest in Amelia.

‘Amy sure seems to like Amelia,’ she said with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

I wasn’t sure if she was upset that Amy wasn’t playing with Ruby, or that Amelia wasn’t. Either way, I felt like I wanted to explain that they’re just toddlers, that their interest in people will wax and wane. But I didn’t think Lilith needed that at this party of carefully chosen friends. Instead I said, ‘She likes her brown-ness,’ my voice low.

Lilith was nonplussed. ‘Oh,’ she said, the edge of something that wasn’t quite anger now gone from her voice. ‘You wouldn’t think that would matter to her.’

I sighed. ‘Today it seems to have made an impression.’

We both silently watched the girls, battling our own particular parental worries. Mine about Amy’s long road of racial confusion. Lilith’s, I imagined, about Amy not playing with Ruby-Mae.

‘Come,’ Lilith said eventually, elbowing me. ‘Let’s grab a glass of wine.’

I looked around. ‘From where?’ I asked.

‘I’ve got one stashed.’ She smiled.

‘Lead the way,’ I said, deciding that a glass of wine in these early stages of my fertility cycle was just what the doctor ordered.

Something strange happened at the park a short time after the birthday parties.

I remember it was a cold day, the beginning of June. The park was emptier, the surroundings starker, and those of us who braved it were wrapped up warm. I can’t remember why Lilith and I decided to go that day instead of letting the girls play at my house. Maybe I was sick of being at home, and aching for fresh air. But I do remember that Lilith seemed keen, and my recollection is that going to the park was as much my idea as hers.

We arrived at about the same time, and I saw Lilith driving past me, parking amongst the trees at the top of the road rather than in full view, where we both usually parked. I meant to ask her about it, but the thought passed and by the time we had the children at the swings, we were both exchanging views on how cold it was and how foolish we were to be at the park, and how difficult it is to keep children indoors in this weather. Lilith laughed and showed me that she had a bag with her, full of ‘extra jerseys’. I teased her about it, because Ruby-Mae was wrapped up like an Eskimo child, her face flushed with warmth where it was visible between her beanie and scarf.

‘Don’t know where you’d put another jersey,’ I said. ‘Although,’ I added, pointing at Amy, who’d decided to only wear a thin Hello Kitty pullover, and nothing I’d said or done could change her mind, ‘maybe I’ll need to borrow one.’

We were sitting near the slides, which Ruby-Mae and Amy were racing up and sliding down, Ruby-Mae with a scarf trailing behind her. Lilith asked me about work, and I talked a bit about a big painting I was busy with – to pay for the IVF, actually.

‘It must be nice to know you can bring in that type of money when you need to,’ observed Lilith, but she sounded wistful rather than jealous.

‘It is nice,’ I said, because what was the point of denying it.

She talked a bit about her morning at work and some of the patients who had made her laugh, and then looked at Ruby-Mae.

‘That scarf,’ she said, clambering to her feet. ‘Better tuck it in.’

I watched her go over to Ruby, and tuck in the scarf. She took her time: unwinding it first, then wrapping it around Ruby-Mae’s neck so that no skin was exposed, and then tucking the ends into Ruby-Mae’s thick outer coat. When it was done, she knelt down and wrapped her arms around Ruby-Mae, kissing her little face all over.

‘Mommy loves you,’ I heard her say. ‘Mommy loves you so, so much.’

‘Rebecca,’ she said when she came back to me. ‘I’m totally desperate for the toilet. Can I run up to the public loos while you watch the kids?’

‘Sure,’ I said, thinking how desperate she must have been to contemplate the general filth and menace of the public toilets. We’d often joked that we’d rather wet our pants, but I guessed that when it came to it, that wasn’t true. And she did look really uncomfortable, almost like she was in pain.

‘Be careful,’ I said smiling and Lilith shrugged, looking distressed.

‘Needs must,’ she said.

I watched her walk up to the gap in the trees that led to the toilets, and then I looked back at the girls, who were playing some complicated game which involved Amy hiding behind the slide and pretending to be a bear. Ruby-Mae went up and down the slide, and Amy tried to catch her.

I glanced at my watch. It was ten to four. I decided that as soon as Lilith came back, I’d leave. I still needed to shop, and cook supper. My mind drifted back to the painting I was working on, and I had a sudden vision of how I wanted it to look. Luckily, and quite unusually, I had my bag with a notebook, so I grabbed it and made a sketch, glancing at the girls every so often. Absorbed in a question of placement – whether the the dog should be full centre or to the side – I made a few sketches. Suddenly Ruby-Mae was in front of me.

‘Where’s my mommy?’ she asked.

‘At the toilet,’ I said, glancing at my watch. It was ten past four. Lilith had been gone for twenty minutes. My heart constricted. Twenty minutes is a long time to spend in the public toilets.

‘I want my mommy,’ said Ruby-Mae, her eyes filling with tears.

‘Let’s go find her,’ I said, suddenly aware of the quietness of the park, and how far away the toilets were. What if something had happened to Lilith, something violent? We were in the middle of Joburg – it wouldn’t be the first time.

I called Amy, and took both girls by the hand. I put both my light bag and Lilith’s exceptionally heavy bag over my shoulder. As we walked towards the toilets, I saw the security guard lounging at his usual post on a bench. Relieved, I decided to go over and ask him for help. But I didn’t want to scare the girls.

‘My friend went to the toilet,’ I said him, trying to convey the urgency of what I was saying with my eyes. ‘Twenty minutes ago. Alone.’ I widened my eyes, glancing down at the girls to explain why I wasn’t saying more.

The security guard looked unworried. ‘The toilets are over there,’ he said with a tilt of his head.

‘I know where the toilets are,’ I said, a fake smile glued to my face. ‘I was thinking maybe you could go and check?’

‘Check?’

‘You know,’ I said. ‘In case ...’ I tried once again to role my eyes to communicate the full situation. Either my charade was useless, or the guard wasn’t interested in following. Instead, his eyes alighted on Amy, whose hand was beginning to squirm in mine.

‘Whose child is that?’ he asked, pointing at Amy. ‘Your friend?’

I probably should have cut the conversation short by agreeing, but I couldn’t deny my child. ‘No,’ I said. ‘She’s mine. This is my friend’s child.’ I lifted Ruby-Mae’s hand, still firmly in my own. ‘My friend who might be having trouble in the unguarded toilets.’

‘How come she’s black?’ he asked, still looking at Amy. I was glad to note that at this point Amy seemed mesmerised by something in the trees next to us.

I knew from past experience that black men found Amy’s existence as my child particularly interesting. I also knew how to deflect it. I glanced down to make sure Amy still wasn’t listening.

‘Her dad’s black,’ I said, offhandedly. It wasn’t entirely a lie.

The security guard perked up. ‘Way to go, sis-tah,’ he said, and gave me a complicated handshake. We were suddenly pals because of the assumed colour of an imaginary lover.

‘Mommy, I thirsty,’ Amy’s voice started up, the tree having lost its hold on her, while Ruby just looked stunned by this strange turn of events.

‘My friend,’ I tried again, hoping to cash in on my new friendship. ‘I’m worried about her.’ It was now at least half an hour since I’d seen Lilith. ‘Maybe I should call the police,’ I said, more to myself than the guard.

‘Why?’ said the guard, affronted.

‘Because my *friend* has been *gone* for half an *hour*,’ I said, trying not to sound frantic. ‘She went to the toilet and she hasn’t come back. For half an hour.’ My words weren’t making any real impression on the guard, but voicing them was making me even more nervous. I dropped Amy’s hand and pulled out my cellphone, and tried to remember what number one was actually supposed to dial for the police. 999? 911? Or was there some special number for my cellphone service provider? I couldn’t believe how unequipped I was for an emergency and was about to phone Sean when I remembered a number: 10111.

But I was pretty sure that if I phoned the police, they’d ask me if I’d checked the toilets, and I could hardly say that I was too scared to go in. So I put my phone away, grabbed Amy’s hand again, and turned our unwieldy chain around. ‘Come with me,’ I said to the security guard, who shrugged, disinterested, but strolled behind us, swinging his baton and whistling.

At the toilets, I didn’t know what to do. It could be dangerous, so I didn’t want to take the girls in with me. But I also didn’t want to leave them with the guard, who seemed to have a very underdeveloped sense of danger for a security guard.

‘Lilith!’ I called from the door. ‘Are you in there?’

Nothing. Silence.

‘You go in,’ I said to the guard.

‘It’s the woman’s toilets,’ he answered, leaning against the wall. ‘I might be misunderstood.’

I thought again about leaving the girls while I went in, but I just couldn’t do it. ‘Here,’ I suddenly said, inspired. I grabbed my purse and took out a fifty-rand note. ‘Maybe this will help you,’ I said, ‘if you’re misunderstood.’

The guard smiled and pocketed the note. ‘Sure, I’ll go look,’ he said, shrugging as if he’d never had any other intention.

The girls made to follow him in, but I quickly pulled them back. ‘We’re staying out here,’ I said as calmly as I could.

‘Why?’ said Amy.

‘Because,’ I said.

Apparently now that this was a paid job the security guard was prepared to participate enthusiastically, because I heard him calling out in the toilets and banging doors open and shut. He even went round to the men’s toilet.

‘Nothing,’ he said, coming out a few minutes later. ‘Totally empty.’

I didn’t know whether to be relieved that he hadn’t found Lilith’s beaten body, or more worried.

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘We’ll check again at the playground in case we somehow missed her, and then I’m phoning the police.’

The girls were looking at me with big eyes.

‘I want my mommy,’ said Ruby-Mae. ‘Where’s my mommy?’

‘Let’s go back to the slides,’ I said, trying to keep my voice calm.

The girls let go of my hands, and took each other’s hands instead. They ran ahead of me, Amy yelling, ‘Slides!’ and Ruby-Mae yelling, ‘Mommy!’ I followed, trying hard not to cry, my shoulder aching from Lilith’s heavy bag.

As we emerged from the line of trees that shield the toilet area from the jungle gyms, I scanned the area for Lilith’s distinctive blonde hair and slight frame. My body felt as if I’d been plunged into cold water. Where was she?

Something terrible must have happened to her.

Then something in Ruby-Mae’s voice changed, and she let go of Amy’s hand and ran off to the right.

To Lilith.

I have never, in my whole life, experienced such a sense of relief. I sank to the ground, put my hands over my face, and started crying. Crying doesn’t even describe it. Sobbing. I sobbed with relief.

Lilith ran towards me and crouched down. ‘What’s wrong?’ she said.

‘I couldn’t find you,’ I stuttered between sobs. ‘I thought something had happened to you.’

Lilith put her arms around me. ‘Sorry,’ she said. ‘I was a bit ...’ She paused, blushing. ‘A bit constipated,’ she admitted.

‘We checked the toilets,’ I said. ‘You weren’t there. I thought ...’ I couldn’t put into words what I’d thought, because I didn’t really know. ‘I thought something bad had happened to you.’

‘I went to check something in my car afterwards,’ said Lilith. ‘I wasn’t thinking. I’m so sorry.’

I looked at Lilith. She looked pale, and a bit like she might have been crying, but it could have been a reaction to my own tears.

‘Please never go to those toilets again,’ I said to her, completely unreasonably.

\*\*\*

I felt traumatised by what had happened at the park, and I needed to talk to someone about it.

When Sean got home that night, he was withdrawn and I had to drag him from his computer to get him to sit down and eat some supper. Those days we ate at the table, after Amy was asleep. But Sean always leaves the television on, and he can see it from his chair, so he tends to watch over my shoulder. I tried to speak casually to him while we ate.

‘I had a strange experience today,’ I said.

‘Mmm.’

‘I lost Lilith in the park.’

‘Mmm.’

‘But it was fine because it turned out she’d been eaten by a dinosaur.’

‘That’s nice,’ said Sean.

‘Oh, just go and eat in the TV room if that’s how it’s going to be,’ I snapped. That one he heard, and took his plate to the couch.

It wasn’t late, so I phoned Rose.

‘Something weird happened at the park with Lilith today,’ I started.

‘I didn’t realise you went to the park today,’ said Rose.

‘I went with Lilith,’ I said. ‘And she kind of disappeared.’

‘I was stuck in the house with Maggie all day. I would have loved to go to the park.’

‘Sorry,’ I said, a bit distressed by how this was going. ‘I thought you had tennis.’

‘Tennis was yesterday,’ said Rose. ‘I only do tennis on Tuesdays. You know that.’

‘Rose, I’m sorry. I got it confused. I would have loved to have you there, especially when I lost Lilith.’

Finally, she let me tell the story. At the end I waited for her reaction.

‘So you found her?’ she said.

‘But that’s not the point,’ I said. ‘It was scary. And a bit strange.’

‘I really think you might be overreacting,’ said Rose. ‘Maybe it’s the hormones.’

I’d told Rose that the IVF cycle had started, but I hadn’t told Lilith. I wasn’t sure why, and I’d meant to tell her at the park, but with all the drama it hadn’t come up.

‘I guess so,’ I said. But I still didn’t feel better when I got off the phone. So I phoned Lerato.

Unlike Sean, Lerato let me talk, and unlike Rose, she didn’t take my visit to the park as a personal insult. If anything, she was too good an audience.

‘It sounds very strange,’ she said. ‘Because you checked the toilet and she wasn’t there.’

‘Exactly,’ I said.

‘And what would she be checking in her car? You said she had that bag full of jerseys with her, so surely anything she needed was in the bag?’

‘I don’t know,’ I said, suddenly getting a glimpse of what Lerato must be like on the few occasions her cases take her to court.

‘She never actually said what she was doing at the car,’ said Lerato.

‘No,’ I said. ‘And I didn’t really ask. I was too upset.’

‘You were upset because you knew something was off,’ said Lerato, in a voice that expected no argument.

‘Maybe it’s the hormones,’ I said, echoing Rose.

‘Do *you* think it’s the hormones?’ asked Lerato.

‘Not really.’

‘Then it’s not.’ Lerato paused. ‘These women are strange, Rebecca. I don’t trust them.’

I laughed. ‘You don’t trust anyone, Lerato.’

‘It’s a good policy, Rebecca. Mark my words. Mark. My. Words.’

I felt better because Lerato had taken me seriously, but by the next morning I had convinced myself that I was overreacting and that nothing particularly serious had happened. Anyway, all had ended well, so I put it out of my mind.

It was a few days later that Lilith phoned me.

‘I have a favour to ask you, Rebecca, but you can say no.’

‘Okay,’ I said.

‘I’ve been invited to this thing, but it’ll mean going away for Saturday night. Is there any chance you can have Ruby-Mae?’

‘For the whole night?’ I’d never had another child to stay for the night.

‘Yes.’ Lilith paused. ‘She’s really easy, Rebecca. And there’s no one else I really feel comfortable with.’

I had a lot of questions. Like, what exactly this ‘thing’ was that was so enticing that the usually obsessed Lilith would allow Ruby-Mae to be away from her all night? And what had happened to buxom Mrs Clarke? And could I actually cope with two children? It was the last question that decided me, because it worried me that I was scared of looking after two children while I was in the process of trying for a second child. So I didn’t ask any of my questions.

‘Sure,’ I said. ‘What time?’

\*\*\*

The whole thing was both more difficult and easier than I had imagined. For a start, Sean seemed suspicious of the whole arrangement.

‘I just don’t understand why she wants to leave her here,’ he kept saying.

The more I explained that Lilith had very few people in her life, the more he protested that that wasn’t our problem, and the angrier I became. The reality was that I actually agreed with him, but it sounded so ugly and uncharitable. I managed to convince myself that looking after Ruby-Mae for a night would be a pleasure, and nothing less than the right thing to do. It’s quite lucky I was in that frame of mind when Lilith told me she wanted to leave Ruby-Mae with us not just for a night, but from nine on the Saturday morning until nine on the Sunday.

‘Sure,’ I said, feeling anything but. ‘No problem ... What is it you’re doing again?’

‘Team building,’ said Lilith with a loud sigh. ‘Out of town for the night. I’ve tried to convince them that I’m only half day so I don’t count. But they seem to think it’ll be fun for me.’

‘Maybe it will,’ I said.

‘As much as I feel confident leaving Ruby- Mae with you, Rebecca,’ said Lilith, ‘it’s still the first time I’ll be away from her for so long. I’m going to miss her so much. I wish I didn’t have to do this.’ She sounded almost desperate, her distress about leaving Ruby-Mae genuine.

‘I’ll text you all night,’ I said quickly. ‘You won’t have a minute’s worry. You might even have fun.’ I gently elbowed her.

Lilith took my hand and squeezed it. I wasn’t sure, but I thought I saw a tear in her eye.

‘You know,’ she said, ‘you’re a great friend.’

On the day of the Big Sleepover, my strategy was to keep the girls busy all day, and out of Sean’s hair so that he didn’t feel put upon. But I was irritated that Sean was so resentful and uninvolved. It made me even more determined to everything right.

Ruby-Mae and Lilith arrived promptly at nine, with an enormous bag of clothes.

‘I’m sorry,’ said Lilith. ‘She made me pack half her wardrobe. And a whole lot of toys. You’d think she was moving in with you.’ Lilith’s voice broke, and I remembered how hard this was for her.

‘Well, you and I both know she’s not,’ I said, patting Lilith’s arm. ‘You’re going to have fun, and I’m going to make sure these girls have fun, and you’ll see her tomorrow first thing.’

Lilith took so long saying goodbye to Ruby-Mae that I wondered if she was ever going to leave. I tried to imagine leaving Amy for a night, but I knew that it would be different for me, because I’d leave her with my mother, or Carl, or even Susan. Family. Eventually Lilith delivered a final kiss, and walked to her car.

‘I’ll keep you posted,’ I called after her.

She managed a smile. ‘Thanks,’ she said. ‘I owe you.’

We set off to the zoo first, and the girls were delighted. Ruby-Mae was easy, engaged and interested in everything she saw. If anything, Amy gave me a harder time, becoming whiny when she thought Ruby-Mae was getting too much of my attention, and at one point sitting down near the elephant enclosure, refusing to move and demanding an ice cream. Being a Saturday, the zoo was fairly crowded, and I suddenly became obsessed by the thought that people looking at us would think Ruby-Mae was my child, and not Amy. I thought of the eggs I was growing in my body thanks to the IVF hormones, and wondered yet again if I had even an inkling of what I was doing.

In the afternoon we went to Rose’s house for a playdate. Rose was put out that Lilith hadn’t asked her to look after Ruby-Mae.

‘It’s like she likes you better,’ she said, her voice almost whiny, and her face confused.

I was slightly offended that Rose found this such an inexplicable state of affairs, but instead of challenging her, I commented that I lived slightly closer to Lilith and maybe that was the reason.

‘Or maybe you just happened to be at the park on the day she needed to ask,’ said Rose, looking happier.

I nodded, deciding it was better not to mention that Lilith had actually phoned me. ‘Probably,’ I said.

And it was fun seeing Rose – we’d perhaps had too many playdates with Lilith, and it had been a while since it was just Rose and me. She seemed mollified when I voiced this, and made a lovely tea party for the girls in the garden.

My plan had been to take the girls for an early supper at Spur without Sean, but he phoned while I was at Rose.

‘I’m missing Amy,’ he said. ‘And I’d better get to know this Ruby-Mae, seeing as we’re apparently her closest relatives.’ But he said it in a kind way, and we arranged to meet at the Spur after I’d left Rose. I thought about inviting Rose and Aidan to join us, but decided it would be more fun just Sean and me and the girls.

I expected that, when we got there, the girls would spend most of their time in the play area, and that Sean and I would have some time to catch up. Amy would happily have gone with that plan, but from the moment Ruby-Mae saw Sean, she was a child in love. She’d met Sean before, but always in passing. He’d arrived at Spur before us, so I herded the two excited girls into the restaurant towards the table where he was sitting, feeling slightly annoyed that he hadn’t bagged one closer to the play area – always my first concern.

Ruby-Mae stopped next to the table.

‘Amy’s daddy,’ she announced.

‘My daddy,’ agreed Amy.

‘But you can call me Sean,’ Sean said with a smile to Ruby-Mae.

‘Amy say Daddy,’ said Ruby-Mae, who’d never made any attempt at prolonged conversation with me.

‘That’s because I *am* her daddy,’ said Sean. ‘But for you, I’m Sean.’

‘*My* Sean,’ said Ruby-Mae.

‘Sure,’ Sean said, with a look of slight panic.

I laughed as I slid into the banquette across from him. ‘That’s weird. I thought you were *my* Sean.’

Ruby-Mae quickly climbed up and sat next to him so that their thighs were flush.

‘Sorry, Rebecca,’ he said, glancing down at her blonde head. ‘Looks like you’ve got competition.’

I took a photo of the two of them on my phone, and sent it to Lilith, as I’d been doing all day.

‘You don’t think she’ll worry about a strange man with her daughter?’ Sean asked. His voice was light, but I knew he was serious. When Sean was eighteen, he’d been accused of sexually molesting an eleven-year-old cousin. It had turned out that the perpetrator was in fact a different cousin, on the other side of the child’s family, and that there’d been a miscommunication. However, from what I can gather, the experience had changed Sean. He’s always very careful with other people’s children, and even with women he doesn’t know. I think that might actually be why I had to approach him that first night, at my show.

‘You’re hardly a strange man,’ I said. ‘And if she was worried about you, she wouldn’t have sent Ruby-Mae to us for the night.’

And maybe that was why she preferred us to Rose. I didn’t know Rose’s husband well, but Lilith had once commented that there seemed to be something ‘off’ about him. I’d laughed, but after that I couldn’t help looking at him slightly warily. Lilith certainly seemed to prefer Sean to Aidan. Of course, I couldn’t tell any of this to Sean in front of Ruby-Mae and Amy, who’d climbed onto the bench next to me and was colouring in the obligatory children’s activity page with her little tongue protruding from between her teeth.

‘Why don’t you girls go play while we order the food?’ I asked, having ascertained what they wanted to eat.

But Ruby-Mae was having none of it. ‘I with my Sean,’ she said matter-of-factly. And indeed that was where she stayed all through the meal, asking his opinion on everything from Barbie to dinosaurs, and laughing at almost everything he said. She obviously missed having a father figure in her life, and I resolved to make a bit of an effort to set Lilith up with some nice single men who might make Ruby-Mae a good father.

The girls fell asleep in the car, and when we got home we decided not to bath them, and gently slipped on their nappies and pyjamas, Sean insisting that I change Ruby-Mae while he did Amy. We tucked them up together in the double bed in Amy’s room, and we each, without needing to say anything, kissed both the sleeping forms good night.

‘She’s a sweet child,’ Sean said later, when we were standing side by side at the basin brushing our teeth.

‘She certainly loves you,’ I said, nudging him with my elbow.

‘Maybe it’s something to do with adoption,’ Sean said, his voice serious. ‘Maybe she instinctively picks up that we’re open to loving children.’

‘Isn’t everybody open to loving children?’ I asked.

‘I don’t know about everybody,’ said Sean. ‘I only know about me.’

It was an obvious thing to say, but I found that deeply profound, and I reached over and kissed him. ‘You’re a really great man,’ I said.

He didn’t respond, but I could see that he was pleased.

Later in the night, when Ruby-Mae cried out for Lilith, it wasn’t me who comforted her, it was Sean. He rocked her back to sleep, and stayed sitting next to the bed for a long time after that.

Lilith had promised that she’d fetch Ruby-Mae at nine on the Sunday morning. By six, both girls were wide awake, watching TV and chatting. They seemed to be involved in a mild argument about Princess Sofia, which I couldn’t really follow, but they appeared to be enjoying themselves.

I sent Lilith a WhatsApp: ‘Girls awake, survived the night. Happy. See you at 9.’

Immediately after I sent the message there was a tick, showing that it had been sent but not received or read. At about 7.10am, I saw that there were two ticks and they were blue. Lilith had read it, and her status reflected, ‘last seen today at 7:02’.

I hadn’t planned anything for the morning, because we were expecting Lilith early. Sean eventually woke up at 8.30am, and when he came into the family room, rubbing his eyes and complaining about his broken night, both girls flung themselves at him.

‘Get dressed, Sean,’ I said. ‘Lilith will be here soon. You don’t want to scare her.’

Sean glanced down at himself. He was wearing a torn T-shirt and some sleep shorts that were so worn I didn’t think they’d survive another wash.

‘I look great,’ he said decisively.

‘Just get changed – she’ll be here soon,’ I said, my nerves slightly worn from the girls’ early start to the day.

He wondered back to the bedroom, mumbling. I heard the shower turn on, and knew it would be a while before we saw Sean again.

‘Where my Sean gone?’ said Ruby Mae.

‘Having a shower,’ I said.

‘Ruby also shower!’ she said in delight.

Amy looked amazed – showering, in her eyes, being a fate worse than death.

‘Okay, hang on,’ I stopped the conversation briskly. ‘No showering with Sean. How about we make *pancakes*?’ I reckoned that even if Lilith arrived while we were eating, she’d be happy to stay.

But 9am came and went, and Lilith didn’t appear.

I fed the girls, and dressed them, and we waited. Ruby-Mae was starting to get anxious. I distracted them with play dough and then I phoned Lilith. The phone rang, but she didn’t answer. I left a message.

At 10.30am Sean said he’d take the restless girls for a walk.

‘What if Lilith comes?’ I asked.

‘Then she can fucking wait,’ he said. ‘Try call her again while we’re out.’

I left another message. ‘Lilith, it’s Rebecca. I’m getting a bit worried about you. Please phone or text.’

After that message, I sat looking at my phone. I realised that I didn’t know where Lilith had actually gone, or any another phone number for her, or even the phone numbers or names of any of her other friends. All I knew was where she lived and I thought I knew where to find Mrs Clarke. If something had happened to Lilith, nobody would know how to contact me, and I wouldn’t know how to contact them. My chest felt tight, but I reminded myself that not everyone felt as strongly about punctuality as I do. Another part of my brain was telling me that Lilith would never leave Ruby-Mae for a minute more than she had to, and that something must be wrong.

I thought that Sean would reassure me when he came home, but he was equally worried.

‘I’ll watch a DVD with the kids’ he said. ‘You go to her place and see if she’s there. Maybe speak to that sex woman.’

‘Okay,’ I said, looking at my watch. It was 12.10am. Lilith was over three hours late. I didn’t know if we were being ridiculous, but I kept thinking that she would never willingly leave Ruby-Mae for so long.

I helped the girls choose a DVD, and Ruby-Mae announced that she needed her teddy. We rooted around in her bag, where we found three teddies, and Ruby-Mae spent some happy moments choosing which one she wanted to take to watch the movie.

I hunted for my car keys and my sunglasses. The green light on my phone was flashing, so I checked my messages. There was a WhatsApp from Lilith: ‘Sorry. On my way!!! Xxx’

I almost started crying with relief. It was like that day at the park all over again, only this time I was much, much angrier.

‘She’s on her way,’ I yelled to Sean, then realised I sounded hysterical. That I *was* hysterical. ‘Your mom will be here soon, sweetie,’ I told Ruby-Mae.

‘What’s her story?’ asked Sean.

‘No idea. But believe me, I intend to find out,’ I said.

‘Mommy’s cross,’ Amy said matter-of-factly to Ruby-Mae.

Twenty minutes later, Lilith arrived full of apologies.

‘I know you’re furious,’ she said as soon as she got out of the car. ‘It’s unforgivable.’

Before I could say anything, Ruby-Mae came barrelling towards her mother. ‘Mommy!’

Lilith bent down and opened her arms. ‘Come for love, Ruby-Mae,’ she said, her voice catching slightly. ‘Mommy’s missed you so much.’

‘I went to the zoo!’ Ruby-Mae exclaimed, then stopped and looked sad. ‘But not my Sean.’

Lilith looked up at me, her eyes red. ‘Sounds like we have a bit of a crush going on here,’ she said with a smile.

But I wasn’t going to let things go that easily. ‘We’ve been really worried, Lilith,’ I said. ‘Where were you?’

‘It ended so late,’ Lilith said, straightening up from her embrace with Ruby-Mae, but keeping one hand on her daughter’s shoulder. ‘I had a bit too much to d-r-i-n-k, and I must have overslept. It was nine when I woke up, and I got here as fast as I could. There was a huge accident on the road though.’

‘Why didn’t you phone? Or message?’ I asked.

‘I thought I would on the road,’ she said. ‘And then the next time I looked, the battery was dead.’ She pulled her phone out of the large handbag she’d slung over her shoulder, and waved it to me so I could see the blank screen.

‘Lilith,’ I said, ‘I was really worried. What would I have done if something had happened to you? I don’t know enough about you or how to contact you.’

Sean had come outside now, with a thundery-looking Amy in tow.

‘I’m sorry,’ said Lilith, sounding on the verge of tears. ‘Next time I’ll leave all the information you need.’

I was stunned by the words ‘next time’. For a start, I’d never imagined that this was anything more than a once-off, especially knowing what a possessive parent Lilith was. And more to the point, I certainly wasn’t going to be put through this again. I was about to say as much when Sean stepped over, and put his hand in the small of my back.

‘That would be great,’ he said to Lilith. ‘We loved having Ruby-Mae with us, and she’s always welcome. But you really scared us. I’m sure you can understand that.’

When Lilith and Ruby-Mae finally left, after much hugging and kissing, I asked Sean why he’d stepped in.

‘I never want to do that again,’ I said.

‘Ruby-Mae was no real trouble, was she?’ he asked. Before I could answer, he carried on. ‘You can see how a mother alone might need a break every now and then. And you said she doesn’t have much of a support system.’ He paused. ‘Do I sound lame if I say that I think Ruby-Mae needs to spend a bit more time with men? With someone like me, who can be a father figure?’

‘You want to be a father figure to Ruby-Mae?’ I wasn’t sure whether to laugh, or cry, or give Sean an enormous kiss.

‘Not a father,’ he said, blushing. ‘But maybe like an uncle. She’s a sweet little girl. I think we can enrich her life.’

Put like that, it would have been small-minded of me to argue. It was only later that night, as I lay awake next to a softly snoring Sean, that it struck me.

‘She read the message at 7am,’ I said softly. ‘If she read the message then, she was awake at 7am. She didn’t oversleep. And then she sent a message after the battery was meant to be dead.’ I knew that there could be many explanations, but the ticks on WhatsApp didn’t add up. It was a long time before I fell asleep.

# Good mothers don’t give up.

The Tuesday after Ruby-Mae stayed over, we did the egg aspiration and fertilisation part of the IVF. I’d forgotten the stress of worrying about how many eggs I would actually make, and how many embryos would result. Sean was morose about having to produce a semen sample on demand, and I snapped at him that the whole thing was his idea, and he should try having swollen ovaries all month, and being knocked out. I reminded him, graphically, about how those eggs would be removed (with a needle, through the wall of my vagina).

‘Fun it is not,’ I spat at him. ‘So in the big picture, I think you can count yourself lucky.’

He stopped complaining after that, because I think he understood that he did have the easiest part of the deal. But at the same time, I knew there was something passive about my role, whereas he actually had to perform on the day, or else the whole thing would be a waste. I tried to be nicer to him on the way to the clinic.

As it turned out, from the ten follicles, or potential eggs that I had grown, we harvested eight.

‘Excellent,’ said Dr Stevenson afterwards. ‘And Sean, your sperm tested well this morning, so I think we’re going to get some viable embryos from this.’

‘Getting viable embryos was never our problem,’ I reminded Dr Stevenson. ‘It’s making them stay in my body that’s the bitch.’

Dr Stevenson looked a bit taken aback, but I smiled to show I meant no harm.

‘I think that what Rebecca’s trying to say,’ said Sean, ‘is that we aren’t going to get our hopes up too soon.’

‘Won’t count our chickens before they hatch, so to speak,’ I said with a laugh.

Sean laughed too. ‘Exactly.’

Dr Stevenson shifted in his seat. He’d never quite got our sense of humour.

That evening, the lab phoned to let us know that three of the eggs had fertilised and we had three embryos. Sean and I then had the debate we’d had every time in the past – how many to put back. On the one hand, you want to have the best chance of having a baby. On the other, we didn’t want triplets. I was also never really convinced that putting three back didn’t actually lessen the chance of one attaching.

‘But we’ve tried all the permutations,’ argued Sean, who wanted to put all three back. ‘It’s not like the pregnancy took when we only put one back.’

I couldn’t argue, except to wonder why we were doing this at all if we were going on past experience.

‘If this is the last time we’re going to try,’ said Sean, ‘then I want us to try everything. Let’s put all three back.’

‘And if we have triplets?’ I asked.

‘Then we’ll manage,’ he said. ‘I can think of worse curses than having four children.’

I wasn’t so sure, but I didn’t feel that I could say so to Sean. I thought four children was two children too many, but just thinking that thought made me feel non-maternal. So I agreed, and three days later Dr Stevenson put all three embryos back into my uterus, and we began our wait.

The first time we’d done IVF, all those years ago, Sean had been absolutely convinced it would work. He’d gone out the next day and had started buying baby supplies ‘just to get on top of it,’ he’d said. I kept reminding him that there was no guarantee, but he’d just explain his theory that the large majority of people actually do get pregnant on their first try of IVF, but that the doctors have to downplay it because of the cases where it doesn’t work. Of course, I’d done a lot more reading about it than he had. I’d read all the stories in the chat rooms of heartbroken potential mothers who still weren’t pregnant after seventeen tries. I tried to manage his expectations, and he refused to listen.

When I didn’t fall pregnant that time, he blamed my negative attitude. He said that a uterus had to be a warm and receiving place to accept a baby, and that I’d made mine hard and unwelcoming. I knew that was crap – look at all the completely unwanted babies whose mother’s uteruses had nonetheless carried them – but it hurt. I lashed back, and blamed him for buying all the baby stuff. I loaded it all into my car and drove around Joburg giving things to startled-looking beggars. Sean told me I was insane, but he never bought baby things again – to such an obsessive degree, in fact, that I could barely get him to buy anything for Amy until she was actually in the house.

This time he said, ‘I want to buy a teddy bear.’

I raised my eyebrows.

‘I think it will make the baby feel welcome, without actually jinxing it.’

He looked so serious that I didn’t have the heart to point out how absolutely little sense his thinking made. Instead I said, ‘You’d better buy three. Don’t want to spark off sibling rivalry in utero.’

‘Good point,’ said Sean, making me worry slightly for his sanity.

He bought three teddy bears, which Amy immediately annexed for herself.

‘Well,’ I said, ‘at least we’ll keep them either way this time.’

Lerato was, as always, fascinated by the process. She didn’t approve of the whole business of having children in general, and had even had a sticker on her car for a while saying ‘Childfree by Choice’. She took it off when I started struggling with fertility issues though.

‘I realise it might be offensive to people who are childfree *not* by choice,’ she explained. I told her that I wasn’t offended, that I still respected her choice, but she’d already convinced herself that it was unacceptable. ‘And anyway,’ she said. ‘It upsets my mom.’

Despite her childfree stance, she seemed to like the idea of fertility treatment.

‘It’s empowering that we can take control of our reproduction,’ she said.

‘It is many things,’ I told her, more than once, ‘but empowering is not one of them. Especially when it doesn’t work.’

‘No, no,’ she assured me. ‘It is. You have laughed in the face of fate. You have revolted against the random throw of the dice. You have taken control of your destiny.’

I’ve learnt not to argue with Lerato when she gets like this. I imagine her colleagues sighing and tossing their papers in the air when she adopts this tone in court. (‘I don’t actually go to court all that often,’ she reminds me.)

This time, she seemed particularly fixated on race.

‘I think this IVF story is a white thing,’ she said. ‘My mother says blacks don’t do this.’ Lerato’s mother, who spent the bulk of her adulthood in exile, is Lerato’s oracle on South African racial norms.

‘Well then come along to the clinic with me one morning, and count how many black couples are waiting.’

Lerato paused to digest this. ‘Those must be the gays,’ she announced.

I sighed. ‘No, Lerato. There are some gay couples, both black and white. But there are also straight black people doing fertility treatment.’ I actually hadn’t personally spotted any gay black couples, but that didn’t mean they weren’t there. And maybe some of the women I thought were mother and daughter were actually gay. Lerato did this to me – got me so fired up about an issue that I lost track of my argument and fluffed the facts. But there were plenty of straight black couples at the clinic, so my point was still valid. ‘Do you think black people don’t suffer from infertility?’ I asked. ‘Are you assuming your own eggs are just fabulous?’

Lerato ignored both my tone and my dipstick racial research.

‘Would you like one of my eggs?’ she asked, her eyes lighting up. ‘That’s a great idea. I could give you an egg, and you could have an Amy-coloured child. And with my genes, it would be very clever.’

‘Your genes frighten the living daylights out of me, Lerato,’ I said. And then gave her a hug, because I knew that she actually meant it, and it was the most generous thing anyone had ever said to me. ‘For now, we’ll stick with my eggs. But thank you. I love you.’

‘It’s nothing.’ Lerato shrugged, but I could tell she was pleased by my gratitude.

I didn’t tell any of my other old friends about the IVF – they’d watched me fail too many times. This time, I wanted to fail on my own. And I suppose that I was also still nervous about what this process said about Amy and my feelings about adopting. Although I knew intellectually that nothing could change my love for Amy, trying for a biological child still felt like a betrayal.

But I did tell Rose and Lilith. I spent so much time with them, and they’d been part of that initial decision to go ahead with it.

Lilith was very interested. She made me take her through the whole process, and discuss the various possible outcomes of each stage. She even went and did some research of her own, and sent me links to interesting articles and chat rooms – nothing I didn’t already know, but I appreciated the gesture. She phoned or sent a text daily, asking me how I was feeling and if I needed any help. I was very tired, which Lilith took as an excellent sign, so I let her come over a few times and entertain the girls while I rested. I knew it was the hormones making me tired, but when Lilith got excited I couldn’t help feeling a faint stirring of hope.

Rose, on the other hand, was uninterested. I don’t know if it was fair to compare her to Lerato, who loves me like a sister, and Lilith, who was a bit unnaturally interested. Maybe Rose’s reaction was actually the norm, and holding it against her was unfair. But I did feel a bit put out that the woman I thought of as my warmest friend never asked how I was, and changed the subject after a few minutes if Lilith got going.

When I mentioned it to Lerato, she showed an unusual empathy with Rose. ‘Do you know why she only has one child?’

‘Because Maggie is only three?’ I said, but the point was well made. I, of all people, should know better than to make assumptions about people’s fertility and situations.

‘Did I tell you I met her husband?’ asked Lerato.

‘Whose husband?’

‘Your friend Rose,’ said Lerato. ‘His company is entering a contract with one of my clients. We were at a meeting together.’

‘How on earth did you know it was him?’

‘I recognised his surname.’

This is why Lerato is as successful as she is: she absorbs information. I had to think for several seconds before I could remember Rose’s surname myself.

‘MacFarlane,’ I finally said.

Lerato looked at me strangely. ‘Yes, I know.’

I didn’t have the energy to point out that I’d been reminding myself, not her.

‘So, what did you think?’ I asked instead.

‘Very good-looking,’ she said. ‘Ve-ry.’

I’d only met Aidan MacFarlane in passing, but good-looking was not the first thing that came to mind when I thought of him. I probably would have been more likely to describe him as ‘inoffensive’. But Lerato and I had never had the same taste in men.

I laughed. ‘If you say so,’ I said.

‘But I think he’s one of *those*,’ she said, matter-of-factly.

Lerato’s world is full of ‘us’ and ‘them’ divisions. When she says someone is one of ‘those’, it could mean anything. I sighed.

‘One of what, Lerato?’

‘You know,’ she said, as if I was a particularly obtuse junior in her office. ‘One of those white men who only like black women.’

Lerato has a whole theory about men, dating and race. She mostly dates white men, although not exclusively, and she reckons this makes her an expert. She’s okay with black men who only date black women, and white men who only date white women, because she says there’s nothing wrong with being comfortable with what you know. ‘If I knew what I know,’ she says cryptically, ‘then maybe I’d also stick with that.’ She also likes men of whatever colour who date both black and white women. ‘Nothing wrong with being open to possibilities,’ she says, contradicting herself.

But she has something about white men who only date black women. ‘Every time a white man has told me that,’ she says, ‘the relationship has ended badly. They have strange, strange ideas, those men.’

‘What about black men who date only white women?’ I asked her the first time I heard her theory.

‘I have no experience with that,’ she answered seriously. ‘But they’re probably also crazy.’

So when Lerato said that Rose’s husband was one of ‘those’ men, I pointed out that she’d missed a small detail. ‘Rose is white, so he can’t be one of ‘those’ men,’ I said, making quote marks the air.

‘Yes,’ said Lerato, ‘that is strange. But I get a funny vibe from him. Like I get from those men.’

‘Did he make a move on you?’ I asked. This was getting interesting.

‘I’m not really sure,’ mused Lerato. ‘But maybe that’s got something to do with how weird Rose is.’ With that, Lerato was through with the subject of Aiden MacFarlane. At least for then.

I wouldn’t have agreed that Rose was weird, and I thought that on the whole, Lerato was talking nonsense, but I took her point about not knowing about Rose’s own fertility situation, so I decided to stop talking about it to Rose. I also made a mental note to stop Lerato passing on all this racial stuff to Amy, whose life would be complicated enough without Lerato’s brand of crazy.

And maybe Rose also realised she’d been a bit strange, because two days later she sent me a huge flower arrangement, with a card saying, ‘Thinking of you. So much love. Rose’.

Maybe I would have preferred to chat face to face, but this was Rose’s way of saying that she cared, even though this particular topic was off her radar. It is a fact that with friends – you have to take them for what they are. And for me, Rose had always been kind and supportive.

I took her flowers for what I thought they were.

# Good mothers don’t gossip.

---

---

Lilith brought up Rose’s flowers the next time we were at the park. Rose had bowed out at the last minute, and I was on day nine of the fourteen-day waiting period before I found out if I was pregnant.

‘I believe Rose sent you flowers,’ said Lilith. She seemed more relaxed that day than she’d been for some time.

‘Did she tell you?’ I said. I don’t know why I found this surprising.

Lilith looked at me, taking her ever-vigilant gaze off Ruby-Mae for a moment. She sucked on her lips, and then said, ‘I don’t know how to say this without sounding bitchy, so maybe I shouldn’t say anything.’

I laughed. ‘Well, you can’t possibly leave it at that. Now I’m going to imagine something terrible.’

Lilith laughed too. ‘Okay,’ she said. ‘She told me yesterday at the park. She made a point of telling me. And she also made a point of dropping it into a conversation with a complete stranger we were chatting to yesterday. Not about the IVF, but that she has a friend who’s going through a tough time and that she’d sent flowers. Like she needed everyone to know how thoughtful she is.’ Lilith smiled. ‘Maybe I’m just jealous that I didn’t think of it.’

I touched Lilith’s arm. ‘You let me talk about it,’ I said. ‘That’s worth a lot of flowers.’

I was tempted to tell Lilith how strange I found Rose’s behaviour. Lilith was, after all, our only mutual friend. But with Lilith I still felt a sense of loyalty to Rose, who I was friends with first. Maybe it’s because I was working so hard at not talking about my feelings about Rose that I brought up the issue of Rose’s husband.

‘What do you think of Aiden?’ I said. We were sitting side by side on the grassy slope, watching the girls on the jungle gym. Something about this aspect made it easier to ask things that would usually seem awkward. I thought fleetingly of the way Lilith used to interview Rose and me in the early days.

Lilith pulled her cardigan around her shoulders before she answered. ‘He’s not my cup of tea,’ she said, after a pause so long that I thought she’d forgotten the question. ‘He’s ...’ She searched for a word but couldn’t seem to find the right one. ‘He’s just off,’ she eventually said. I remembered then that she’d actually said this about him before.

‘Lerato would agree,’ I said, but didn’t elaborate.

Lilith smiled. ‘I like Lerato,’ she said, as if bestowing a gift, which perhaps she was. Not a lot of people get Lerato. ‘She’s gutsy and loyal and clever,’ said Lilith. ‘I’d want her on my side if I needed help.’

I thought Lilith was done with the subject of Lerato, because she jumped up to run over to Ruby-Mae, who’d tripped on a piece of loose canvas at the bottom of the slide. I watched Amy leaning against Lilith, both of them looking carefully at Ruby-Mae’s knees. Ruby-Mae gradually stopped whimpering and took Amy’s hand. The two of them went and sat together on the grass near us, and Lilith returned to me.

‘The girls are so cute,’ I said. ‘The way they look out for each other. Like sisters.’ I rubbed my tummy before I could stop myself.

Lilith smiled at me, and bumped her shoulder against mine. But she wasn’t done with the topic of Lerato. ‘Lerato, I think, would always look out for you,’ said Lilith, as if this was a perfectly logical response. ‘Sometimes you need someone like that, with the things life throws at you. You can cope with curve balls, because you have people like Lerato and Sean. Bright people. Loyal people. Connected people.’

I didn’t really know how to respond. With anyone else I might have pointed out that they had good people too. But Lilith didn’t really have much of anyone, besides Rose, myself and Mrs Clarke.

‘How’s Mrs Clarke?’ I asked, then blushed, realising how transparent my train of thought was. Before I could apologise, Lilith answered.

‘Eugenie is like an angel here on earth,’ she said. ‘I know it seems unlikely, what with the sex shop and everything. But she is.’ Lilith scratched absent-mindedly at an ant that had crawled onto her ankle. ‘The problem with Eugenie is her health. You just can’t count on a person with that many health problems. And I should know.’

Once again, I found myself at a loss for words, but Lilith seemed a bit manic that day, and simply carried on.

‘Who have you left Amy to in your will?’ she asked. ‘Who gets them if you die?’

I looked at her. ‘That’s quite a personal question.’ I wasn’t really sure why I found it uncomfortable, but I did find myself a bit taken aback by her use of ‘them’. How could she be so sure my IVF would work?

‘Is it?’ she said. I expected her to quickly change the subject, but she just looked at me.

‘Carl, my brother, or Sean’s sister, Susan. Depending who’s more able to take her. We’d trust either of them.’

‘Options,’ said Lilith, as if I’d proved some sort of point. ‘It’s all about options.’

I was trying to formulate some sort of response – maybe even take the bull by the horns and ask her if she felt that she had no options. But it seemed, again, that she wasn’t done.

‘That’s what I like about you,’ said Lilith. ‘You are a person with options and plans and support.’

I laughed. ‘*That’s* what you like about me?’

Lilith laughed too. ‘Oh dear, that sounded terrible.’ She patted my arm, a tentative butterfly of a touch. ‘I actually like so many things about you, Rebecca. I hope that you’ll always be a big part of Ruby-Mae’s life.’

Did I find our conversation strange, that day? Did I find it ominous in any way? I don’t think I did.

---

# Options

---

---

I didn’t feel like a person with options five days later, when I found out I wasn’t pregnant. I felt like a person who’d hit a brick wall. I couldn’t even cry.

The bleeding started on day thirteen. It shouldn’t even be possible to bleed that early, with all the hormones you take. But it did. I tried to convince myself that it was implant bleeding, but it was too late and too heavy, and eventually I had to recognise that it was a period. We didn’t even bother with the pregnancy test – I just went to Dr Stevenson and told him about the blood. I think part of me was still hoping that he’d insist on a pregnancy test because of some lesser-known pregnancy side effect. But he didn’t.

‘We can try again,’ he said. ‘Maybe another laproscope and then another cycle?’ He reached out and touched my hand. ‘Rebecca, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t get pregnant. You just need to keep trying.’

I withdrew my hand. ‘So you keep saying,’ I said. ‘So you’ve said for years. But we both know that’s crap. I’m not going to get pregnant, and you’re going to get rich.’ I paused. ‘Richer.’

I got up and walked to the door.

‘Goodbye, Dr Stevenson,’ I said. ‘I’m done.’

Of course, I felt bad about it later. It wasn’t Dr Stevenson’s fault that I couldn’t get pregnant. To use an overused phrase – it was what it was. I sent Dr Stevenson an email apologising, and he came back saying that he was ready to start again whenever I wanted to. But I knew that I was done.

I felt flat. I couldn’t seem to work up any grief or disappointment, or even relief. Sean’s reaction was also strange. He was overwhelmingly cheerful and optimistic, and kept saying things like, ‘Okay, we tried. That’s done and now we can adopt again,’ and, ‘Adoption is what we know, anyhow,’ and, ‘Family cohesion is all that matters.’ Actually, I had no idea what that last one even meant, and he said it about once a day, but I just nodded and agreed. But I didn’t phone the social worker, or do anything to hasten the adoption process. In fact, all I did was sit around drinking cups of tea and staring at the wall.

Amy knew I wasn’t right. She’d come over to me and stroke my head. Once, she said, ‘Mommy? Where are you?’

‘I’m here, baby,’ I said.

‘No, not here.’ She shook her head emphatically and I waited for some new insight from my tiny oracle. But then she said, ‘Can Ruby come play?’

I laughed for the first time in days and agreed that yes, Ruby was just the answer. I phoned Lilith and she sounded tired when she answered, but said they could come right over.

‘It’s a good idea,’ she said. ‘Perk us all up.’

When Lilith arrived I could see that she wasn’t exaggerating – she *did* need perking up. She looked thinner than usual and pale, with large blue bags under her eyes.

‘Are you okay?’ I asked, giving her a hug.

She smiled. ‘I was about to ask you the same.’

‘I’ll make you a deal,’ I said. ‘I’ll tell you the truth if you tell me the truth.’

‘O-k-a-y,’ she said, sounding wary.

‘I’m shit,’ I said. ‘I am absolutely terrible, and can barely get out of bed. I didn’t even want to try to get pregnant, and now that I can’t, I’m devastated. It makes no sense. I make no sense.’

‘I don’t think things are meant to make sense,’ said Lilith, speaking slowly. ‘I think if we try to make sense of our lives and our challenges, there lies the path to madness.’

‘You might be right,’ I said. ‘But I still feel like shit.’

Lilith laughed. ‘I think you’re allowed that. Can I make you a cup of tea?’

I nearly got sidetracked – Lilith had such a way of doing that to me – but this time I managed to stay focused. ‘Your turn,’ I said, ignoring the talk of tea. ‘What’s going on?’

Lilith sighed. ‘Oh, I’ve just had a virus that I can’t shake. I feel tired and sick and, quite frankly, Ruby-Mae is exhausting me.’

At this point, Ruby-Mae was chasing Amy around our garden, both of them shrieking at the top of their voices. I could see that she’d be exhausting in a small flat if you weren’t feeling well.

‘You should have said so,’ I said. ‘I’m so sorry – I didn’t realise you were ill.’

‘Oh, I’m sure it’ll pass. I just need some rest.’

‘I’ve got an idea,’ I said. ‘Go and sleep now. I’ll look after the girls. You can even sleep here, in the guest room.’

I hadn’t really expected her to agree to that bit. I thought she might leave Ruby-Mae and go home for a nap.

‘Could I?’ she said.

‘Sure.’

I showed her the room, and brought her a cup of tea. ‘Sleep as long as you need to,’ I said, pulling the door closed behind me.

I spent the afternoon playing with the girls. Strangely, it was easier sometimes with two, and I actually enjoyed myself. I felt better than I had for ages, and was grateful to Lilith for giving me that chance. At about six, I peeped into the spare room and Lilith was still fast asleep, the tea cold next to her bed.

I fed the girls and bathed them, putting Ruby-Mae into a spare set of Amy’s pyjamas. Sean came home, and I explained the situation to him. I expected him to be irritated, but he was sympathetic.

‘It must be hard when you’re on your own,’ he said. He read to both girls, and Ruby-Mae was delighted. Eventually, she fell asleep leaning against Sean, Amy on the other side. I picked her up and put her into bed next to Lilith, who was still asleep.

Sean and I were a bit unsure of what to do – we didn’t mind Lilith spending the night, but we were worried that she’d wake up in the dark and panic. I settled for putting a note next to the bed, explaining that the burglar alarm was on but wasn’t armed in the toilet or kitchen, in case she needed anything.

I didn’t sleep well, and checked on her several times during the night. The last time I checked, her arms were wrapped around Ruby-Mae and I could have sworn there were small smiles on both faces; mirror images of each other.

I must have finally fallen asleep, because when I woke up, Sean had already left for work and the house smelt of coffee and frying bacon. I found the girls watching TV, wrapped up in a shared blanket on the couch and eating bacon sandwiches. In the kitchen, Lilith was cooking more bacon, and eggs.

‘Oh no,’ she said when she saw me. ‘I wanted to bring you breakfast in bed.’

‘Oh,’ was all I managed. I was a bit thrown by her wholesale ownership of my kitchen.

‘I hope you don’t mind,’ she said, waving a spatula. ‘Sean showed me where everything was, and I really wanted to find some way to thank you.’

‘It was nothing.’ I accepted the cup of coffee Lilith handed me.

‘It wasn’t nothing,’ she said, her back to me as she started dishing up a plate of breakfast. ‘It was everything. I feel so much better. You did that for me.’

She put the plate of food on the table and went to the kettle to pour herself some tea.

‘Anyone would have done the same,’ I said, sitting down. ‘But I’m glad you feel better.’

Lilith sat across from me, cradling her tea. ‘Anyone *might* have done the same, although I’m not even sure of that,’ she said, ‘but you’re the only one who makes me feel totally safe. I knew you’d look after Ruby-Mae perfectly, so I could let go.’

I didn’t really know what to say, so instead I started eating. ‘Thank you,’ I said, after the first mouthful. ‘This is delicious. Aren’t you having anything?’

‘I can’t really eat in the morning,’ she said with a small shrug. ‘But I enjoyed cooking for you.’

I heard a shout of laughter from the lounge, and Amy yelled, ‘Princess!’ I felt a wave of well-being wash over me.

I smiled and raised my cup of coffee in a toast. ‘We should do this more often,’ I joked.

Lilith laughed. ‘Don’t tempt me,’ she said.

I sipped my coffee and put it down. ‘Lilith, you can ask me for help whenever you need it. Don’t shut your friends out.’

Lilith’s neck flushed and her eyes seemed to tear up. ‘Thanks,’ she said. ‘That means a lot to me.’

For a moment I thought she was going to say more. She looked at me, and I was sure she was about to tell me something important. But when she eventually spoke, she said, ‘More coffee?’ and the moment passed.

\*\*\*

Lilith’s stay had changed something for me, and I made contact with our social worker, Clarissa Grant, a day or two later.

Clarissa seemed pleased to hear from me. We’d become close during Amy’s adoption in the sense that we’d spoken on the phone most days, and she’d seemed to really care that we got a baby and that it all happened as quickly as possible. I always presumed that this is how she was with all her clients, which was why she’s one of the most popular private social workers in the adoption field. That, and the fact that she worked for the state for many years, so has excellent contacts within the system. I hadn’t expected her to forget me, but at the same time I didn’t think the details of my life would be at her fingertips.

‘Hi Clarissa, it’s Rebecca Prince here,’ I started.

‘Rebecca!’ she said. ‘How are you? And Sean? And dear little Amy? I think of you so often.’

I’d forgotten Clarissa’s habit of asking so many questions in a row that you didn’t know what to answer first. I could imagine her surrounded by Post-it notes stuck to bits of paper, a chaos that belied her obvious organisation.

‘We’re all good, Clarissa,’ I said. ‘How are you?’

‘Oh, excellent, excellent,’ said Clarissa. ‘Busy, busy you know. So many babies, so many parents. And Amy must be nearly three now? Already three? She must be a lovely girl.’

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Just turned three, and very lovely.’ I decided that as much as I loved Clarissa, I wasn’t going to tell a social worker that I didn’t find Amy lovely twenty-four seven.

‘And I imagine that you’re ready for another babe now?’ said Clarissa, getting straight to business.

‘Yes, I think we are,’ I said. Again, no need to burden her with our brief dalliance with fertility treatment again, unless she asked.

‘Lovely, lovely,’ she said. I heard paper rustling in the background. ‘Should I come round next Friday at ten, and we can go through the process and update your records, and I can have a little visit with Amy too? Always so lovely to see one of my babies growing up.’

I agreed, a bit unclear as to whether seeing Amy was actually part of the assessment for the next adoption, or just something Clarissa wanted to do.

I phoned Sean and told him that I’d set up the meeting.

‘Good for you, Rebecca,’ he said. ‘I know this has been a hard road.’

‘No harder than before,’ I said. ‘Strictly speaking, easier.’ Then I told him about what Clarissa had said about meeting Amy. ‘What if Amy doesn’t measure up?’ I said. ‘What if we’ve done such a bad job that we can’t get another baby?’

Sean laughed. ‘Amy’s magnificent. If she’s the test that we have to pass, they’re going to be throwing babies at us. Begging us to take more. Leaving them on our doorstep.’

I couldn’t help smiling, as he’d intended. ‘You think?’

‘I know,’ he answered. ‘Rebecca, we’ve done good with Amy. I know she tests you sometimes, but that’s because she’s a happy, healthy and self-confident three year old. Being monstrous is part of that.’

Just then, I heard a crash and Amy’s voice saying, ‘Uh-oh.’

‘Gotta run,’ I said to Sean. ‘Sounds like she’s exercising her happy confidence right this second.’

‘Love you,’ said Sean. ‘And I’m excited.’

‘Me too.’

And I was. Lilith had been right. I was a person with options.

# Gut feel

---

---

I was energised by setting up the appointment with Clarissa, and this showed in so many ways. In the first place, I decided that it was time for Amy to start at nursery school. I contacted all the schools in our immediate area, and made appointments with those that had space, or thought they might have space in the near future. I didn’t know how long the adoption process was going to take this time, and I wanted to be ready to look after a new baby. At the same time, I wanted to establish Amy at school before that, so that she didn’t feel ousted by the new arrival. I felt confident, like all my mothering synapses were firing on full blast.

The first two schools drained that confidence. At the first one, which was in a private home with all sorts of outbuildings, I was greeted by a girl who was nineteen at the most. She had greasy hair and a rash of spots around a lip piercing.

‘I’ve got an appointment with Anne?’ I said, hoping this wasn’t Anne.

‘S’my mom,’ said the girl. ‘S’out. I’ll show you ’round.’

She stood and looked at me, and I waited a few moments. I thought about simply turning around, but eventually I said, ‘Well, I guess you’d better.’

‘’Kay,’ said Greasy Hair, as if she knew as well as I did that I would not be choosing this school. She opened a security gate, which we walked through. She locked it behind her.

‘Security’s important,’ she said in an absolute monotone. Then she opened a door to the left. ‘Babies in here.’

I glanced in. An old black woman dozed in a corner, while two small babies lay on their backs in cots, staring at the ceiling. A slightly older child was batting a ball around the floor. I felt sick.

We walked down a passage, and she opened a door to the right. ‘Three year olds in here.’

Inside there was another childminder – this one, at least, awake. On her lap was a little girl about Amy’s age, with her thumb in her mouth, and a river of snot from her nose to her lip. Two boys sat on a faded mat, playing with a small collection of Lego.

‘Only three of them?’ I asked.

Greasy Hair scratched her elbow. ‘I think there’s more outside.’

‘With a teacher?’ I asked hopefully.

Greasy Hair looked at me. ‘A teacher? What ya gonna teach a three year old?’ She laughed. ‘Like, maths? Nah – the girls can watch them.’

‘The *girls*?’ My voice was faint to my ears.

Greasy Hair pointed at the childminder, who looked wearily at me.

‘Where’s your mother?’ I asked Greasy Hair. ‘Isn’t she supposed to be in charge?’

‘Ag, ja, but the kids make her tired,’ said Greasy Hair. ‘She goes out.’

I almost ran out of the place, and spent several hours thinking that maybe I should report the school to someone. But when I spoke to Lilith, she said she’d seen a lot like that, and at least someone was watching the kids.

‘I’m not saying send Amy there,’ she said. ‘It sounds dreadful. But I’m just saying that it’s not the worst, and it’s the best some families can afford.’

The next school that I looked at was the opposite.

‘I don’t take more than ten children,’ said a woman called Hazel as soon as she’d met me at the gate. ‘I have a waiting list, you know, but you sounded like the right sort of person. I’ll show you around and then we’ll see from there.’

She glanced at Amy, who was with me this time. ‘It’s a wonderful thing you’ve done, adopting her. She’s lucky,’ she said.

I cringed. This sort of observation, made so often and no doubt with good intentions, makes all my hairs stand up. Can’t people see that I’m the lucky one?

Hazel led us into her school, which was a converted building at the back of her large property.

‘Lots of schools claim to be Montessori,’ she said. ‘But they’re not the real thing. I’m the real thing. I know that’s important to you.’

Actually, I had no strong feelings about Montessori one way or another, but Hazel seemed better than Greasy Hair so far, so I nodded, as if this was my main concern. Apparently this was not enough, as Hazel eyed me for a response.

‘Yes,’ I said, and we were allowed to move on.

Hazel then gave me an item-by-item tour of the large play area.

‘Locks and keys,’ she said, pointing at a shelf. ‘Fine Motor. Bricks.’ Pointing to another shelf. ‘Gross motor.’ And so on, through every item in the room.

‘As you will know,’ she said speculatively, as if she knew I did not know, ‘with Montessori, we give children choice. They spend the day on the activity they need that day.’

‘Oh,’ I said. ‘In that case, Amy might spend all day every day playing make-believe.’

Hazel pursed her well-glossed lips. ‘We do not encourage making things up,’ she said. ‘You mustn’t worry. We’ll sort that out here.’ The way she said ‘sort that out’ made me wilt, but I kept picturing the other school, and this was better.

‘Where are the jungle gyms?’ I asked, trying to change the subject.

Hazel’s eyes opened wider, although her expression remained neutral enough that I suspected Botox. ‘Jungle gyms are very, very dangerous,’ she said. ‘Do you know that nine out of eleven playground accidents occur on jungle gyms?’

‘Nine out of eleven?’ I asked, because that sounded like a most unlikely statistic. But Hazel took my response as shared horror. ‘Exactly,’ she said. ‘Jungle gyms are almost as bad for children as additives.’ She paused. ‘We ask our mothers to only send wholewheat nut- and gluten-free bread sandwiches. And water. Juice,’ Hazel’s voice became shrill, ‘juice is absolutely the worst thing a child can drink.’

I pictured what Amy would rather be doing right now: watching cartoons, drinking a juice and eating Flings.

‘I don’t think this is going to work,’ I said to Hazel.

She looked me up and down. ‘Probably not,’ she agreed.

I was starting to wonder if I needed to home school Amy, but we still had one more school on the list. This school was only two blocks away from our house and I decided to take Amy along for the walk so that the day wasn’t completely wasted.

We stopped at number 109 to do a post swap on the way.

Our house is number 106, and we suspect that the postman is a little bit dyslexic, because our post often ends up at number 109, and theirs at us. That day we had three bills and what looked like a card.

I rang the bell and told Mrs Blundy that it was us.

‘Oh good,’ she said over the intercom. ‘I’m coming.’

I handed over her post through the bars of her gate, and she handed me about ten letters addressed to us.

‘I’ve had some of these for ages,’ she said, as if it was my fault.

‘Why didn’t you drop them off,’ I asked, indicating our house, less the two hundred metres away. ‘Or phone me to come over?’ I’d given her my phone number at least three times.

Mrs Blundy waved her hand. ‘Why must I be running around?’ she asked. ‘It’s not my mistake.’

‘It’s not mine either,’ I said, trying to keep my voice even. ‘But I always bring your post as soon as I get it.’

‘Yes,’ she said, looking at me. ‘You do.’ This was said neither in admiration or gratitude, but rather in a way that indicated mystification at my strange neighbourly behaviour.

Standing outside the gate, I rifled through the pile of letters while Mrs Blundy looked at Amy with her nose slightly wrinkled, as if she smelt something bad. A lot of the post was junk mail, but there were some bills, which were probably now well overdue.

‘Mrs Blundy,’ I said, speaking slowly and evenly, ‘one day I’m going to miss something important because of this. All you need to do is send me an SMS when you get my post, and I’ll come over. Can I give you my number again?’

‘Oh,’ she said, ‘I’ve got your number.’

This was apparently as far as the conversation was going, because she turned her back on us and walked back into the house.

‘That lady’s being mean to Mommy,’ said Amy.

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘For some reason, she is.’

We looked at each other and we both started laughing. ‘Let’s go have a look at that school,’ I said.

‘Yes! School!’ echoed Amy, her hand in mine, and despite my irritation with Mrs Blundy, I felt quite cheerful.

\*

The school was a converted house, and as we approached we could see the garden filled with apparatus, and children playing.

‘Look, Mommy,’ said Amy. ‘A park.’

‘Let’s check it out,’ I said, ringing the bell at the security gate.

A woman of about forty-five, dressed in jeans and a floral shirt, came to the gate and let us in.

‘You must be Rebecca Prince,’ she said, holding out a hand and giving me a firm handshake. ‘I’m Trish. I’m the headmistress of the school.’ She smiled and put air quotation marks around the word ‘headmistress’, as if she knew this was a bit ridiculous.

‘Good to meet you,’ I said.

Trish knelt down. ‘And you must be Amy,’ she said. ‘I’m happy Mom brought you along to look.’

‘At the park,’ said Amy.

‘It’s a school,’ said Trish. ‘But it looks like a park, doesn’t it.’ She took Amy’s hand, and I waited for Amy to flinch and pull it back, or even cry. Instead, Amy looked at her hand.

Trish showed us around, pointing out which classroom Amy would be in, and introducing me to the teacher, Maureen. Both Trish and Maureen spent some time talking to Amy as well as to me. Scarred by my previous experiences, I asked about jungle gyms, imaginary play and snacks.

‘Our big thing,’ said Trish, ‘is that children need to be children. Sure, we have an agenda of things we want them to learn, but our first focus is always on whether they are happy.’

Looking around, the playground seemed to bear witness to this approach. Children laughed and played, and where one little girl sat alone, looking sad, a minder sat with her, stroking her back and talking softly to her.

I didn’t need to ask the fees, or anything else. I already knew: I’d found a school for Amy. Trish was delighted when I said I wanted her to start as soon as possible.

‘We’ve just had a pair of twins emigrate in Maureen’s class,’ she said. ‘You could start next week.’

She explained to me how we would acclimatise Amy to school, with me coming with her for a short time on the first day, slowly working up to a full day. I was delighted with this plan, having dreaded simply dumping Amy in a stranger’s arms.

# Schooling

---

---

The first person I told about the new school was Lilith, simply because we saw each other at the park that afternoon.

‘You know,’ she said, after I’d told her about my experiences, and she’d laughed at all the right parts, ‘I’m not that crazy about Ruby-Mae’s crèche any more. The staff have changed, and I just don’t have that good feeling.’

This was the first I’d heard of it, but it seemed plausible. I’d feel very let down if I’d carefully chosen a school and then the staff changed.

‘Maybe I should look at your school,’ said Lilith. ‘See if they have more places.’

I wasn’t sure if she was asking me if she could or telling me that she would, but either way, my first reaction was how fabulous that would be – Amy and Ruby-Mae together. It would make Amy’s transition so much easier to already have a friend. I told Lilith about the twins who’d emigrated, and made her phone the school immediately, while I was sitting there.

I listened as Lilith explained to Trish that she was a friend of mine, and that she was interested in the other place at the school. She listened to something that Trish said.

‘I don’t really need to look,’ said Lilith to Trish. ‘If Rebecca is happy, I’ll be happy.’ But Trish must have insisted, because Lilith set up a time to go the next morning.

‘Will you start at the same time as us?’ I asked when she got off the phone. ‘If you like it.’

Lilith frowned slightly. ‘I’ll lose this term’s fees at the crèche,’ she said. ‘But if it means Ruby-Mae is happier, then it’s worth it.’

‘It’ll be such fun,’ I said. ‘And they’ll have each other.’ I’d become a bit obsessed with the idea that Ruby-Mae must start with Amy, and almost offered to pay for the first term, but I stopped myself. I didn’t want to offend Lilith.

‘Yes,’ said Lilith. ‘They’ll have each other. That’ll be great.’

I’m not sure if we had the thought at the same time, but Lilith said it as I thought it: ‘Rose is not going to love this.’

I laughed, but it was so true that it made me uncomfortable. ‘She’s had Maggie down for a school near her house since the beginning of time,’ I said. ‘She’s always going on about it, and about how you have to be down on the list from birth. She can hardly get upset with us.’

‘True,’ said Lilith, but without conviction.

I looked across the park and saw a familiar figure. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I guess we’ll soon find out.’

Rose came straight up to us, and Maggie ran off to join Amy and Lilith. ‘Am I interrupting?’ she said, standing above us. She was smiling, but the words had a bite.

‘Of course not,’ said Lilith.

‘We ran into each other by chance,’ I said, then hated myself for making excuses, no matter how true. ‘And now you’re here, so it’s perfect.’

Rose obviously decided to accept this at face value.

‘I could not take another minute in the house with her,’ sighed Rose, indicating towards Maggie with her head and sitting down next to me, on the other side from Lilith. ‘I can’t wait for her to start school.’

‘Funny you should say that,’ I said. ‘We were just chatting and discovered that by pure coincidence we’ve been looking at the same nursery school for Amy and Ruby-Mae.’ I had no idea if Lilith would play along – we’d never been in a situation like this before. For all I knew, she was one of those people obsessed with the truth at all costs.

Lilith smiled and turned to Rose. She seemed to move slowly, but that was probably my guilty conscience; I’ve never been a good liar.

‘Isn’t it an extraordinary coincidence?’ Lilith said to Rose.

‘Oh, that’s nice,’ said Rose, and I felt a tension I hadn’t realised was there leave my shoulders. ‘What school?’

We told her, and she spent the next fifteen minutes telling us all about why the school she’d chosen was better, but that we’d never get in at such a late date, but that she was sure our school would be very nice. Rose, I was starting to realise, paid a lot of lip service to non-competitive mothering, but had areas where she was as bad as the next person. I gave an internal shrug, supposing that we all have our issues.

Rose ended her monologue with the statement, ‘Well, I’m sure it’ll be fine for your girls,’ with just the slightest emphasis on the word ‘your’. I noticed it, but was feeling so relieved that Rose wasn’t angry about that same-school thing that I didn’t react. But the usually relaxed Lilith took her up on it.

‘What do you mean, *our* girls?’

‘I don’t mean anything,’ said Rose. ‘I’m sure it’ll be nice.’

I expected Lilith to drop it, but she didn’t. ‘But not nice enough for Maggie?’ she hit back.

‘I never said that,’ said Rose. Which was true, but it had been the implication.

I was sitting between the two of them, and didn’t want this to continue.

‘We all choose what we feel is right for our girls,’ I said, in an unnecessarily loud voice. ‘And sometimes those things are going to be different.’

Rose took a moment, and then seemed to pull herself together. ‘I’m sorry if it came out wrong,’ she said, leaning across me and touching Lilith’s arm. ‘I really didn’t mean anything by it.’

Lilith took a deep breath. ‘Okay,’ she said, and then paused. ‘I get a bit defensive, I guess. It’s tough making decisions as a single mom.’

‘Oh shit,’ I said. ‘I haven’t asked Sean what *he* thinks about the school. I’d better find a way to make him think he chose it.’

We all dissolved in laughter, and the awkward moment passed. But when I thought about it that evening, I did wonder what Rose had meant, and whether she saw Maggie as somehow better than Amy and Ruby-Mae. Was the adopted brown child and the single mom’s daughter deserving of less, in Rose’s eyes?

I couldn’t talk to Rose about it, obviously, and I didn’t want to get Lilith riled up again, so when Amy was asleep I phoned Lerato and asked what she thought.

Lerato sighed dramatically as I finished the story. ‘So it’s started?’ she said.

‘What’s started?’

‘The part where you second guess all your decisions and interrogate every remark that everyone makes, all in the name of motherhood?’

I was hurt. ‘I’m not like that, Lerato.’

‘Well,’ she said, ‘your mommy friends are making you like that. I haven’t heard you unpack the nuances of somebody’s statement like this since Josephine Catskill said you had big boobs in standard nine.’

‘She meant it as an insult,’ I said on reflex.

‘She meant it as a compliment,’ said Lerato, sounding deliberately bored, and we both laughed.

‘So Rose meant this as a compliment?’ I said.

‘Jesus, I doubt it,’ said Lerato. ‘I don’t like or trust that woman. But that’s not my point.’

I waited, but she wanted me to beg.

‘What is your point?’

‘That it’s all completely and totally irrelevant and ever so slightly boring. If you’re happy about this school, and happy about this other little one going, then who cares what Queen Rose of the flowing robes thinks?’

‘Shouldn’t I be happy about Ruby-Mae going?’

‘What am I?’ said Lerato. ‘God?’

‘You just sounded like I shouldn’t be happy about it.’

‘So now we’re unpacking my statements as well.’ Lerato laughed. ‘Okay. I’ve decided that I actually like that Lilith chick, and the kid seems fine. I just think it’s a bit odd that suddenly she wants to change schools to be with you. A bit stalkery.’

‘Lilith’s not stalkery,’ I said, but I sounded uncertain even to my own ears.

‘She is a bit,’ said Lerato. ‘Her boundaries are a bit strange. But, as I’ve said, I like her.’ Lerato loves the word ‘boundaries’.

Sean came wandering through to the bedroom, where I was lying speaking to Lerato. He lifted up my shirt and started kissing my stomach.

‘Lerato,’ I said, ‘I gotta go. I think Sean wants sex.’

‘I do,’ said Sean, his voice muffled against my flesh.

‘Gross,’ said Lerato. ‘Too much information.’

‘Bye, sweetie,’ I said.

‘Bye. Have fun.’ Lerato laughed and rang off, and I put the phone down and reached for Sean.

Because the best side effect of our decision to adopt again was that fun sex was back on the cards. The worst thing about fertility treatment is that sex becomes – at best – a chore. It must happen on certain days and sometimes not on certain days. It’s very hard, even on the days that you aren’t trying to have a baby, to just see sex as a leisure activity. So while I was so unexpectedly sad about the failed IVF, at least we could go back to normal in the bedroom.

The next day Lilith saw the school and said she loved it. ‘They’re so kind,’ she gushed. ‘And Ruby-Mae seemed to really like them.’

I laughed. ‘You don’t have to sell me, Lilith,’ I said. ‘I’m already going.’

Trish had seen no reason that the girls shouldn’t start school on the same day, and Lilith and I had agreed that we’d start together the next Monday.

‘Sooner the better,’ said Lilith. ‘Best to get everything in place.’

And I thought she was talking about my adoption.

# Money

---

---

In the time that I now think of as ‘Before’, Ruby-Mae spent the night at us twice more. The first was with Lilith.

‘Rebecca,’ Lilith had said to me on the phone, ‘I have the most awful favour to ask. They’re fumigating the flats and we need to spend one night somewhere. Is there any chance we could come to you? I’d go to a hotel but money is so tight and —’

‘It’s no problem,’ I interrupted her. ‘We’d love to have you.’

And it was a very pleasant evening. Lilith and I bathed the girls, then Sean read them bedtime stories while I cooked us supper, and Lilith perched on the counter in the kitchen, chatting to me and sipping a glass of wine.

I’d been complaining about how little time I was getting to paint those days, and Lilith must have been a bit drunk, because she suddenly said, ‘Explain to me how it works, Rebecca. The money side – how it is that you can make so much money from one painting?’

I was a bit taken aback, but I suppose lots of people wonder about this and no doubt think that it’s unfair.

‘When I started the Dogs,’ I explained, ‘they took off as a trend. The prices grew and grew. Left to itself, the trend would have spiked and prices would’ve dropped. But Joanne then started cutting back how many we sold, making it harder and harder to get a Dog just as the trend was about to peak. That doubled the demand. At first, Joanne managed how many we released, but since Amy, I really don’t produce that many anyway, so the supply side almost self-regulates.’

‘Will it all implode at some point?’ asked Lilith.

I’d often wondered this myself.

‘Joanne says that if we’re clever, it shouldn’t. We might even start a new trend item at some point. Basically, I do what Joanne says.’

‘You’re lucky to have someone so astute looking after it all,’ said Lilith.

‘I really am,’ I said. ‘Money’s just not be a worry any more, thanks to Joanne. And it looks like Sean and Adam’s app might take off, so that’s also great. We’re really lucky.’ I stopped myself, suddenly feeling bad talking about money and luck with a woman who was clearly down on both.

‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I think I might be being insensitive.’

Lilith reached out a hand to me, a slightly awkward gesture because I was just out of reach and wasn’t sure if I was supposed to step towards her and take her hand, or just leave it. I stepped forward and sort of patted her hand, which felt stupid. But her words were reassuring.

‘Rebecca, it makes me happy that someone like you, someone so nice, has had good luck. It gives me hope. It makes me believe in the future.’ She stopped. ‘Some days, it’s very hard for me to see the future.’

Sean came back just then, and the talk became less intense. We laughed a lot, the three of us, and went to bed later than usual. The next morning, all three adults were slightly hung over, and Lilith looked like death.

‘Not used to drinking that much,’ she said, smiling weakly.

So Sean took the girls out for a ride while we sat with strong coffee and Myprodol, saying very little.

The next time Ruby-Mae spent the night was unremarkable. Lilith explained that she had another work function – with a few choice words about her new boss, who was behind all these functions – and she left Ruby-Mae with us. As always there was a big bag of clothes, and this time it was topped with a list of contact people. The list was a bit depressing: it had Eugenie Clark, Lilith’s boss’s cellphone and the landline at her work, the hotel where the function was, their GP and someone Lilith said was an aunt.

‘Sorry, Rebecca,’ said Lilith. ‘I know you and Sean want a whole list of contact people, but my life’s just not like that. To be honest, I’m not even sure the aunt is still at that number, and I can’t imagine a scenario where she’d be of any use. But still.’

‘It’s okay, Lilith,’ I said, and of course it was. Lilith actually arrived back to collect Ruby-Mae half an hour before she said she would, and the five of us – Sean, Lilith, me and the girls – ended up spending the whole day lazing about at our place. Lilith even made lunch because I was feeling tired and lacklustre.

‘I just wish we’d hear something about the adoption,’ I moaned to Lilith. ‘Every time I speak to Clarissa, she tells me to be patient. I’m tired of patient. I’m tired of waiting. And right now, I’m just tired.’

Lilith was sympathetic. ‘It’ll all suddenly come right. The child you’re waiting for will find you.’

I liked that – the idea that there was some sort of mutual cosmic search party taking place. My baby looking for me, and me looking for my baby.

\*\*\*

The girls had started school by then. They’d both settled in easily, and I’d got into the habit of fetching Ruby-Mae when I fetched Amy every day at one o’clock.

‘You don’t need to,’ said Lilith. ‘I can be there by one-thirty. The school says that’s fine.’

‘It’s no trouble,’ I said. ‘She looks so confused when I leave her. I just can’t. These girls are like sisters – I can’t take one home and not the other.’

Lilith smiled broadly. ‘What a lovely thing to say,’ she said. ‘Thank you. I’ll fetch her from your place then. But let me know when it doesn’t suit, or when I can help you out.’

Things also seemed to be back to normal with Rose – we had a few playdates with all three girls, and Rose was back to her chatty and friendly self. She was also completely distracted by a new habit: moaning about her husband. It seemed that Aidan had taken to working late, and travelling a lot.

‘He got promoted and now it’s all out-and-about and get-on-the-plane,’ said Rose. ‘I know it comes with the territory but I feel so angry.’

It was during a playdate at my house, and the three of us were sitting drinking tea in the lounge while the girls watched a DVD in the TV room. Not exactly textbook parenting, but it was freezing outside. We’d all agreed ‘just this once’ and then laughed at ourselves for pretending that we were such organised moms that DVDs weren’t often a solution.

‘Wouldn’t you love to just get on a plane,’ I asked in response to Rose, probably not taking her worries as seriously as she wanted, ‘go somewhere and then just sleep?’

‘And maybe go shopping and to the beach,’ added Lilith.

‘No,’ I disagreed, ‘just sleep. I want to go somewhere and sleep.’

We’d got off the subject of Rose’s husband, but the truth was that I’d been feeling so worn out that sleep was all I could think of.

Lilith looked at me. ‘I think you might be coming down with something.’

‘That’s rich,’ I said. Lilith had been pale and listless for most of the afternoon, and she’d developed a hacking dry cough. ‘I’ll make you a deal,’ I said. ‘I’ll go to the doctor if you do.’

Rose suddenly looked worried. ‘If you guys have some horrible virus and Maggie and I catch it, Aidan will be furious.’

I thought she was joking, but she put down her teacup and started gathering her stuff.

‘Are you seriously going?’ I asked.

‘Rebecca,’ she said, ‘I just can’t afford to get sick.’ She waved a hand in front of her face, as if warding off unwanted germs, and hauled Maggie off the couch in the TV room. ‘I’m sorry, Rebecca, but it’s not fair.’

‘Um, okay,’ I said, not quite sure what wasn’t fair. I walked her to her car, and was careful not to hug or kiss her goodbye. I hadn’t been particularly worried about my health, but being treated like a pariah had me thinking that maybe I’d better have a check-up after all.

Inside, Lilith was coughing again.

‘She might have a point,’ I said. ‘We are neither of us an inspiring sight.’

Lilith laughed between coughs, and nearly choked. I brought her a glass of water, and her hand shook slightly as she took it. ‘I just need to sleep,’ she said.

‘Me too.’ We both sighed. ‘But please – let’s also both go to the doctor. Not because of Rose, but we might well have caught the same virus.’

Lilith nodded, but her eyes were unfocused and I wasn’t sure if she was actually listening to me.

‘Rose sometimes seems a bit nuts,’ Lilith observed out of nowhere. ‘I’m glad I found you.’

I smiled. ‘You make it sound as if it was either or,’ I said. ‘Maybe if you hadn’t met us, you’d have met far nicer park moms.’ I waited for Lilith to laugh, but she looked at me with her full attention.

‘You’re the perfect friend, Rebecca,’ she said, and her intensity made me uncomfortable.

I patted her hand, which was cold to the touch, and went to get us more tea. It wasn’t the first time I’d felt that Lilith needed something from me.

# Rebecca

\[digi note: This needs to be circled to emphasise the last item on the list, and the fact that Lilith has chosen Rebecca.\]  
Lilith phoned me that night and said she’d taken my advice and made an appointment with her doctor for the next afternoon. She asked if I could look after Ruby-Mae, and I agreed.

‘You get yourself to a doctor too,’ said Lilith, her voice faint. ‘No point in both of us being man down.’ She coughed. ‘Gugu can look after the girls,’ she said. ‘Please don’t feel that you can’t go out because Ruby-Mae is there.’

I was going to make the appointment first thing the next morning, but Lerato phoned. Lerato’s days, she is often at pains to point out, are busy, and she – I quote – ‘can’t be yabber-yabber-how-are-things-with-you-ing’ all day. So when Lerato phones, I normally expect her to get straight to the point. We save our meandering conversations for when we’re together.

So I was a bit surprised when, after greetings and an obligatory discussion about Amy’s whereabouts and well-being, Lerato didn’t seem to have anything to say.

‘How’s things with your mommy friends?’ she asked. Her voice was strange, like she wanted me to believe that she didn’t care what the answer was, but that she really did.

When I told Sean about that later, he told me there’s no way a person can read all that in another person’s voice. ‘I don’t know about those persons, Sean,’ I’d answered. ‘But when it’s Lerato, I know.’

‘Why do you want to know about my mommy friends?’ I asked Lerato. ‘Do you want me to tell you I still love you best?’

‘Of course you still love me best,’ she said in a much more normal voice. ‘I was just wondering? How’s that one with the one at the school? And that Rose?’

‘Why do you remember Rose’s name and not Lilith’s?’ I asked.

‘No reason,’ said Lerato. ‘Stupid name, though. So, all fine then?’

‘You’re weird,’ I said.

Lerato sighed. ‘I know.’

We were silent for a bit.

‘Want to tell me why you really phoned?’ I asked, after I’d watched the second hand do a full round of the clock on the wall in the kitchen.

I could hear her breathing, but she took a few beats to answer. ‘No,’ she said. ‘But thanks.’

‘Sure,’ I answered, mystified.

We said our goodbyes, and I sat for some time trying to figure out what had just happened. Something was wrong with Lerato – that much was clear. But I couldn’t solve the puzzle. After a bit, I gave up, and went to dabble in my studio.

By the time I finished – I’d painted a miniature dog, a new idea that I was excited to share with Joanne – it was almost time to fetch the girls, and I still hadn’t phoned the doctor. I wasn’t feeling as drained as the previous day, so I decided to leave it till the next day. I was wondering what Lilith’s doctor had said to her as I grabbed my keys and set off to school.

Lilith’s appointment was for two, and the plan was that she’d come and fetch Ruby-Mae on the way home. As I cleared up the girls’ lunch plates, I got an SMS saying that the doctor was running late, with some crazy-looking emoticons next to the message, which made me laugh. At about three-thirty, I got another message saying, ‘On way.’ But by the time she actually arrived it was four-thirty. The girls had been good, if somewhat messy – taking every fluffy toy from Amy’s room and making a bed in the passage for them to sleep in. ‘Sleep, babies, *now*!’ Amy kept yelling, and Ruby-Mae would echo, ‘Now!’ So I wasn’t that put out by Lilith being late, and was preparing to tease her: ‘Nobody but you could take an hour to be on the way for three kilometres,’ was what I’d planned to say.

But when I saw her, the words froze in my mouth.

She looked awful, like she’d been crying. Her eyes were bloodshot, and the skin underneath was bruised and loose.

‘What’s wrong?’ I asked, taking her arm and guiding her in, relieved that Ruby-Mae hadn’t run out to see her.

Lilith breathed with a small shudder. ‘Oh, I just had a small meltdown, you know,’ she said, forcing a smile. ‘The doctor thinks I have a virus. Viruses can’t be medicated easily. I just have to wait it out, and I’m so tired. I am very, very tired. So I just had an enormous cry about it.’

Her tone was flat. Like she was reading a script. I put this down to her exhaustion, which I’d witnessed for myself.

‘What did he say you should do?’ I asked. We reached the house and went in, me almost guiding Lilith to a chair, where she half sat, half collapsed.

‘There’s nothing I can do,’ she said, looking at her lap. Then she seemed to recover herself. ‘What I mean is, he says I must rest, which is the most pointless advice to give the mother of a toddler. So I feel like there’s nothing I can do. Just ... nothing.’

I sat down next to her. ‘I wonder if I have the same thing, but milder,’ I said. ‘I’m tired the whole time, but you seem way worse. No offence.’

Lilith laughed weakly. ‘None taken.’

‘Because if there’s nothing but rest that’s going to help, I’m not going to bother going to the doctor. Waste of money.’

Lilith grabbed my arm, her grip unexpectedly tight and looked at me. ‘Rebecca, it’s really important to look after one’s health. Please, please go to the doctor.’

‘Lilith, I know you’re feeling overwhelmed,’ I said, pulling my arm away gently, ‘but viruses pass. If I have it too, we can lie in bed and rest together, and Sean can look after the girls and bring us endless cups of tea.’ I smiled.

‘That sounds nice,’ said Lilith. ‘But I’ve got a bigger favour to ask.’

‘Okay,’ I said, pretty sure of what was coming.

‘The doctor thinks I should check into hospital for two nights. So I can really rest ... Could you take Ruby-Mae again?’

‘When?’ I asked.

‘I want to spend the weekend with her,’ said Lilith, her hand worrying the crescent scar on her arm. ‘I thought Monday and Tuesday. That way they’re at school in the mornings, and you wouldn’t have to look after them all day.’

‘And then you’d fetch her on Wednesday after school?’

Lilith looked at her hands. ‘Yes. After school. I’m pretty sure I’ll be better by then.’

I rubbed her back. ‘I’m sure you’ll be better too,’ I said. ‘Wouldn’t you rather stay here and I’ll look after you?’

Lilith took my hand. ‘Rebecca, you’re such a good person. I am so grateful to you, and I’m sorry I’m creating all this trouble for you.’

‘Two nights is hardly trouble,’ I said.

‘Yes,’ said Lilith, ‘but still. Please know how grateful I am, how safe I feel knowing that Ruby-Mae is with you. If she can’t be with me, this is the right place for her.’

‘I’m taking that as a no,’ I said, and pretended to sulk. ‘You’re choosing hospital over being taken care of by me?’

‘They’ll give me medicine,’ said Lilith. ‘You know, to help me sleep. That’ll make it better and quicker.’

‘Well, if you’re sure. It’s really no problem having Ruby-Mae for two nights. And Amy will be thrilled.’

I asked her what hospital she was going to, and it was the same hospital where I’d had my laproscopes back in the days before Amy was born, so we talked about the food, and I joked that I’d better bring her some home-made meals. Lilith looked slightly panicked at the idea.

‘Please don’t visit me or anything, Rebecca,’ she said.

‘My food’s not *that* bad,’ I joked, although honestly I was a bit hurt. I was looking after her child, and she didn’t want to see me? But she answered my unasked question head on, in that way she had.

‘Two things. I’m supposed to be resting, and you make me laugh. I don’t think my grumpy doctor will buy into that. More importantly though, I’m only going to be able to rest if I know that Ruby-Mae is safe.’

I didn’t point out that she’d already told me she felt fine about me leaving the girls with Gugu, or that I’d most likely visit her in the mornings during school. And I knew that her second reason was just to make me feel better; the real reason was that her exhaustion was so severe that she really needed to get away from everything. Including my visits.

I understood. Or I thought I did.

We talked a bit more about the details, and then Lilith sighed deeply, and said she’d better get Ruby-Mae and be on her way. I hugged her goodbye.

That was the Tuesday.

\*\*\*

On the Wednesday, Lilith sent me a text to say that Ruby-Mae had a slight cold, so she was keeping her home from school. I worried that Ruby-Mae might have caught Lilith’s virus – something that could fell an adult as it had Lilith couldn’t be good news for a small child. And if Ruby-Mae had it, then what about Amy? I was feeling much better myself that day, but I took Amy’s temperature about seven times.

That evening I sent Lilith a text asking how Ruby-Mae was, and asking if it was anything I should look out for. She didn’t respond immediately, and I became worried that I’d offended her. That maybe it seemed like I was putting my own child first.

But just before I fell asleep, a message came through: ‘R-M is fine. Just sniffles. Doc says no virus. Playing it safe and keeping her home this week.’

Of course, I believed her.

# Monday

I didn’t hear from Lilith again that week until the Sunday, when she phoned and apologised for being so out of touch.

‘Are we still good for this week?’ she asked.

‘Sure,’ I said. ‘We’re looking forward to having Ruby-Mae.’

This wasn’t entirely the truth. My lethargy had come back over the weekend, and I’d decided to make an appointment with my doctor first thing on Monday. I probably could have done without an extra child around in the coming week, but I knew that Lilith’s need was greater than mine. And at the back of my mind I kept thinking about the baby I hoped we’d be adopting soon: I needed to get used to life with two children.

When I’d said this to Sean, he’d pointed out that having a baby would be quite different from having Ruby-Mae. ‘But I’ll help you,’ he said. ‘There’s something about that little girl that tugs on my heart strings.’

‘Like maybe the fact that she worships you,’ I suggested, smiling.

‘Oh, that helps.’ Sean laughed, but he also looked thoughtful. It was so obviously true: there was something about Ruby-Mae that really called out to him.

Lilith dropped Ruby-Mae at school on Monday morning, and then dropped Ruby-Mae’s bag off at our place. Usually Lilith and I arrived at the school at about the same time, but that morning I overslept, and when I got to school Maureen, the teacher, was rocking Ruby-Mae.

I walked over with Amy holding my hand.

‘Everything okay?’ I said, stooping to give Ruby-Mae a kiss on her head.

‘Mom’s just left,’ said Maureen. ‘She was a bit ... emotional.’

‘Did she explain the situation to you?’ I asked.

Maureen nodded. ‘It was hard for Rubes,’ she said, stroking the child’s back. ‘But I explained that Mommy was just sad because she loves Ruby so much and will miss her.’

‘Exactly,’ I said, although I felt a bit uncomfortable with the way Maureen had shortened Ruby-Mae’s name. Lilith never did that. ‘And we’re so excited to have you to stay at our place, Ruby-Mae,’ I said. ‘We love you too.’

Amy was stroking Ruby-Mae’s hair through this, and eventually Ruby-Mae turned her teary face to Amy. Amy took her hand and Ruby-Mae slid off Maureen’s lap. The two girls went off into the classroom, dark head leaning against light, and Amy turned only to give me a small wave, although she normally made a big production of her goodbye kiss.

‘You can be very proud of what a compassionate child Amy is,’ said Maureen, reading my mind. ‘There’re not many at this age who even register what their friends are feeling.’

‘I am very proud of her,’ I said. ‘And she does seem to have a special bond with Ruby-Mae.’

Maureen looked at me. ‘You must be worried about Lilith?’ she asked.

I laughed. ‘It’s a virus, Maureen,’ I said. ‘Of course she’ll get better. She’s just really worn out, which is why her doctor wants her to rest so thoroughly.’

Maureen nodded. ‘You know her better,’ she said, pushing her glasses up her nose. ‘You two obviously go back years.’

I would have explained that, in fact, we only went back a few months, but I suddenly felt a wave of tiredness. I don’t know if it was my general fatigue, or a more particular tiredness borne of constantly explaining myself and my relationships to other people. So I smiled, and told Maureen that I’d better be off home, and that I’d fetch the girls together at the usual time.

\*

I’d expected to find Lilith waiting at the house, but I didn’t. She’d already been, and had left Ruby-Mae’s suitcase with Gugu. And a large suitcase at that – one of those supersize things people use when they’re immigrating. It looked new, but I knew Lilith wouldn’t have bought this monstrosity just for Ruby-Mae’s stay at our house. I stroked it where it sat waiting in the hallway, wondering idly if it was the bag Lilith had used when she ran away from her ex.

Gugu also handed me a note Lilith had left – handwritten and scrawled on a piece of lined paper:

\[digi note: handwriting typeface needed for this note\]

> Rebecca,
>
> Sorry this is so HUGE but I had no idea what she might want so I just threw in a whole lot. I even put a blanket at the bottom in case she needs that to feel at home – but probably totally unnecessary so maybe just leave that in until you really need it!
>
> Thank you, thank you. Remind Ruby-Mae that I love her.
>
> L
>
> \[end note\]

I sighed and dialled Lilith’s number, but the phone went to voicemail, so I sent her a WhatsApp wishing her luck.

In Amy’s room I unpacked the stuff at the top of the case – Ruby-Mae’s toddler toothbrush and toothpaste, her facecloth, shampoo, detangling spray, soft hairbrush, pyjamas and a few changes of clothes. I really had no idea why Lilith had to pack so much every time, but I was used to it. I thought back to the day she’d disappeared and scared me in the park, and the huge bag of jerseys she’d had that time. I laughed, alone in the girls’ room. We all have our things, I thought.

We’d moved a spare single bed from the storeroom into Amy’s room after some debate.

‘She’s used to sleeping in her own room, isn’t she?’ said Sean. ‘Maybe she’d be happier in the spare room?’

‘To be honest,’ I said, ‘I don’t think she actually sleeps in her room. I think she sleeps with Lilith, and chances are she’s going to climb in with us. But at least this way she won’t be alone.’

‘Seems a lot of work for two nights,’ Sean said as we struggled to fit the bed through a doorway.

I grunted. I’d realised that I really wanted Ruby-Mae to enjoy her stay. I think on some level I thought this was the Universe’s way of testing whether or not I was ready for another baby. That, if I got this right, Clarissa would phone with good news. I didn’t tell Sean that. I knew he wouldn’t get it; or would feel the need to make me see things more rationally.

I didn’t want to see things more rationally.

The new baby would, of course, sleep in what had been the spare room. I’d thought about getting it ready: I’d heard stories of second adoptions where you get a few days’ notice and suddenly – wham! – you have a baby. But I reckoned a few days was enough. And anyway, what does a new baby really need with a fancy room? At the beginning, it would sleep in a camper cot next to Sean and my bed, the same way Amy had.

I was getting all tense thinking about the new baby, so I took a teddy from Ruby-Mae’s bag and put it on her bed. The rest of the stuff I left in the suitcase, which I shoved under the bed. If she needed anything over the next two days, we could get it. And if not, all the less to pack on Wednesday morning. I had a final chuckle to myself as I wondered how much luggage Lilith would have taken to hospital. The nurses probably thought she’d made a wrong turn on the way to the airport.

I went to my studio to paint, and only remembered that I’d meant to make a doctor’s appointment just before I left to fetch the girls. On the good side, I’d made another perfect miniature dog – five centimetres by five centimetres – with carefully worked detail, some bits using only a few hairs of a paint brush. It was still one of my classic dachshunds, but in tiny settings with minute and painstaking detail.

I was so excited about the new turn my work had taken that I sent Joanne a text: ‘Come see something new. R’

‘This afternoon?’ she replied almost immediately, and I said yes, that’d be perfect. I still wasn’t quite used to how quickly she was at my beck and call – but I loved it. When I’d commented on her reliability, she’d said, ‘You’re my cash cow, Rebecca, let’s be honest. Basically, I drop everything for a chance to sell your work.’

When I’d told that to Sean, he’d thought it rude, but I actually think it’s one of the most affirming things anyone has ever said to me. Although for a while I did take to mooing at her every time she answered the phone.

So I left the studio and picked the girls up from school, and because that was our usual routine in any event, Ruby-Mae was unperturbed. When we got home, I showed her the bed she’d be sleeping in for the next two nights, with her teddy, and her clothes in the cupboard.

‘Two sleeps?’ she asked, fingering the worn edges of her teddy’s ears.

‘That’s right,’ I agreed. ‘Two sleeps, and then Mommy will come fetch you.’

‘One, two sleeps,’ she repeated.

I wasn’t sure of it was a question or a statement, so I carried on, my voice with a false bright edge.

‘It’s going to be such fun, Ruby-Mae,’ I said, my one hand taking hers and my other stroking the back of Amy’s head. ‘And let’s get started with hotdogs for lunch.’

Ruby-Mae’s hand felt small, her bones lighter than Amy’s, her grasp less sure.

‘Becca?’ said Ruby-Mae.

‘Yes, love?’

‘I Ruby. Not Ruby-Mae.’

I felt like I was being disloyal to Lilith, but I really wanted Ruby-Mae to feel happy with us.

‘Ruby-Mae is a beautiful name, sweetie,’ I said. ‘But if you prefer Ruby, well that’s lovely too.’

‘Ruby.’ Her voice was sure.

I laughed again. ‘Great, now that we’ve got that established, let’s have hotdogs.’

I settled the girls at the table with their hotdogs, and an apparently hilarious debate ensued about the relative merits of eating Vienna sausages with tomato sauce (which was on offer) and peanut butter (which was not). I was a bit worried about Joanne coming to look at the work while the girls were around, but I hoped they’d stay with Gugu while I took Joanne through to my studio.

My studio is a converted outbuilding with north-facing floor-to-ceiling windows, and an enormous work table in the middle. I know some artists have messy, disorganised work spaces, and don’t allow anyone to clean or touch their stuff. But I am meticulously organised in my space, and with Gugu’s help I keep it very clean. I have shelves with designated spaces for all my paints and brushes, a lower set of narrow shelves for paper, a place for finished works (although I hold on to few of those these days) and mood boards set up between stations. I also had a small table for Amy, with a drawer for her paints and crayons. I didn’t let her play there when I was working seriously, but sometimes when I was desperate I’d let her draw while I painted, or else we’d go down the garden to the studio especially for her to play. Ruby had never been to the studio before.

When Joanne rang the gate bell, I asked Gugu to watch the girls, but they both immediately followed me to the front door. Gugu seemed powerless to stop them, so I turned and said to them, ‘If you come with me, you have to be very good. Understand?’

They both nodded solemnly, and we all went out to greet Joanne.

Up until that day, when I’d thought about Joanne, I’d always had this mental picture of her dressed in black, wearing bright red lipstick, with Trixie at her elbow. Both of them had wine glasses in their hands, and neither of them were smiling. Before, Joanne had normally come around when Amy was at school or with Sean – I’d tried to keep a vaguely professional division between being a mother and being an artist. It had never occurred to me to wonder if Joanne liked children, but my gut answer was that she didn’t – I imagined that she’d find the presence of two little girls very irritating. But I rationalised as I walked to the driveway that these were special circumstances. And, as Joanne would be the first to agree, as cash cow, I got to call the shots.

When we reached Joanne’s car, she’d already got out. She was wearing tall brown-suede boots with impossibly high heels, and tight cream leggings. The outfit was topped with a soft cream jersey that managed to both hug her figure and look snugly warm. If I’d worn that outfit, and managed to walk, by this time of the day it would have been covered in paint and muddy hand marks, not to mention tomato sauce and crayon.

I self-consciously readjusted the oversized shirt I was wearing, and wiped my hands on my faded jeans. When I’d got dressed that morning, my Mary Janes and chunky beads had felt like boho-chic. Now, I just felt drab. But Joanne could not have been less interested: she was down on her haunches greeting the girls.

‘Now, who are these two princesses?’ she said.

Amy has never been one to hold back when asked.

‘I am Amy. This is Mommy. This is Ruby for two sleeps. Who are you?’ She put her hands on her hips and pushed her face close to Joanne’s. I suddenly noticed a smear of tomato sauce under Amy’s nose, only slightly diluted by a snail trail of snot. Joanne didn’t even flinch.

‘I am Jo,’ she said. I almost jumped – I’d never dreamed of calling Joanne ‘Jo’. ‘I sell your mommy’s lovely paintings.’

‘Mommy paints dogs,’ said Amy, hands still on hips.

‘That is totally true,’ said Joanne. ‘Mommy probably paints the best dogs in the world.’

‘Yes!’ said Amy loudly, her face close to Joanne’s, as if scoring a point in a parliamentary debate.

Ruby had stood back for most of this exchange, but now stepped forward and touched Joanne’s soft jersey. ‘Soft.’ Then she touched Joanne’s lips. ‘Red.’

Joanne smiled. ‘Ruby,’ she said, ‘I think you have the makings of an artist.’

The four of us made our way to the studio, the girls each holding hands with Joanne. When we got there, I hastily dug around for some paper and crayons, which I put on Amy’s work table. ‘You two can stay and make art of you are very quiet,’ I said to them, in what I like to think of as my no-nonsense voice.

‘Shh, Mommy’s working,’ said Amy theatrically, sitting down at the table.

‘Ruby be’s quiet,’ agreed Ruby, sitting next to her.

Joanne beamed – beamed! – in delight. ‘Angels,’ she said, and then sighed. ‘I suppose we’d better look at your work now.’

‘You’re the one who wanted to see it so quickly,’ I said.

‘Yes, but that was before you offered me the chance to play with these two.’

‘I’m quite surprised, Joanne. I never took you as a children’s person.’

‘Why, because I’m gay?’ Joanne asked, her voice tightening.

‘No, not at all.’ I blushed, because the thought was so far from my mind that it hadn’t occurred to me Joanne might reach that conclusion. ‘Because – well, this sounds stupid – but because you’re so elegant.’

Joanne laughed generously, showing the depths of her mouth. Then she tipped her head and looked me straight in the eye. ‘I love children, Rebecca. I absolutely and completely adore them.’

‘So why don’t you have any?’ I asked. ‘And don’t say because you’re gay, because if I’m proof of anything, it’s that there’s more than one way to have a child.’

‘Trixie and I are talking about it,’ said Joanne. ‘It’s not something we tell many people, but we’re looking at a sperm donor or adopting. There’s this thing where they use one person’s egg, but the other woman carries it, so you both feel biologically connected to the baby.’

The comment left her mouth and sank into the space between us.

‘Oh God, Rebecca,’ said Joanne, her face growing pale with a flood of blush in the area around her nose. ‘I didn’t mean it like that.’

‘You have the most peculiar blush,’ I said, because that was what I was thinking.

The red spread onto Joanne’s cheeks. ‘I know,’ she said. ‘I try very hard not to blush, but I’m really embarrassed that I, of all people, would be so insensitive. Being biologically connected to a child is not that important.’

I smiled, and patted her hand. ‘I actually think the egg-and-carrying thing is a lovely idea,’ I said. ‘I’d totally do that.’ I paused for a moment. ‘If I was gay.’ Another moment. ‘And if my eggs and uterus actually worked. Definitely.’

We were both silent for a moment and then burst out laughing, that kind of teenage hysteria that seldom happens to adults. I’d known Joanne for about ten years, and never actually laughed with her – but this one was worth the wait.

When we had both sufficiently recovered, we looked at the paintings. Joanne loved them, and was fascinated by the technique. I explained that I’d gone through a miniature phase at university, even going on a specialised two-week course with a woman who lived in the Cotswolds, and who was known as an excellent miniature teacher. I’d loved that time – five art students from all over the world had somehow lived in two bedrooms in the artist’s cottage. We painted all day, learning the tricks of the miniature world while pushing the artist’s numerous overweight cats off the chairs and tables where we were working, and ate and sat. I’d moved on to a new technique when I got back to Joburg, and until now had never used the skills I’d learnt in the Cotswolds.

‘Well, you certainly seem to remember them,’ Joanne said after I’d told the story. ‘These pieces are fascinating. I think we can make them big. So to speak.’

I was delighted, and inspired. I wanted to start another one immediately, and I said as much.

‘Well,’ said Joanne, ‘why don’t you?’

I glanced at the girls and back at her.

‘I’ll play with them,’ she said, and before I could even open my mouth, she’d crouched down next to them in those perfect cream pants, and Amy was explaining the finer points of her crayon drawing, and Ruby had a hand entangled in Joanne’s smooth hair, and all three looked blissful.

So that’s what we did the Monday afternoon that Ruby came to stay. The girls played with Joanne, and I painted. The process is slow and you need to let paint dry, so I started a few, and touched up the one I’d worked on the previous week. I could hear the girls laughing – first near me in the studio, and later when the three of them went outside, I heard giggles and shrieks, and wasn’t sure if it was coming from the girls or Joanne.

At some point in the afternoon Trixie joined them, and when I’d finished working, the three of us cooked spaghetti and sausages for the girls, and had a glass of wine around the kitchen counter while they ate.

Trixie was unexpectedly dressed in gym clothes. Of course, she still looked svelte and elegant, but she also had a few wisps of hair out of place. She seemed more relaxed than I had ever seen her. She was smiling, which I’d never seen before, and it transformed her face – I could understand now why Joanne had fallen in love with her.

Joanne and Trixie were completely spellbound, and kept telling each other how cute the girls were, and what cute thing each girl had said to them, and how much fun they’d had. Then Sean came home and offered to bath the girls. Joanne and Trixie joined him, the three of them squeezed into the space next to the bath in Amy’s bathroom, while I cleared up the plates. Then Joanne and Trixie joined me on the patio for another glass of wine, while Sean read the girls a story and watched them fall asleep, Trixie went out and got sushi for the adults. We ate it off our laps, and talked about children and joy and whether Joanne and Trixie should adopt or do IVF.

It was a wonderful, relaxed, fun evening.

# Tuesday

On Tuesday, after I dropped the girls at school, I tried to make an appointment with my doctor.

‘Dr Malcolm is away until Thursday afternoon,’ said the receptionist, an elderly woman I’d never warmed to. ‘Would you like to see Dr Nutten instead?’

I’d seen Dr Nutten once. He was a middle-aged man with a sheen of sweat on his brow and an almost permanent string of saliva connecting his top lip to the bottom. He had listened to my heart somewhere in the vicinity of my ovaries, and had seemed very anxious to check my breasts for lumps. Which would have been less unsettling if my reason for visiting wasn’t a sore throat and blocked sinuses.

‘I’d rather actually die then see Dr Nutten again,’ I said without thinking, then suddenly worried that Dr Nutten might be the elderly receptionist’s son. ‘I mean, I’m just more comfortable with Dr Malcolm.’

The receptionist grunted. ‘I can fit you in on Thursday at three.’

‘Thank you,’ I said, trying to sound suitably grateful and not like a difficult, Dr Nutten-hating person. ‘That’s perfect.’

It obviously wasn’t perfect at all, but I shrugged off my unease. Whatever was wrong with me wasn’t going to change in the next few days.

I spent the morning painting and fetched the girls from school feeling more energised than I had for a while. It was as if the act of making a doctor’s appointment had actually cured me, and I laughed at myself. Such a hypochondriac.

I decided to send Lilith a WhatsApp: ‘Girls good and happy. Am feeling better – hope you are too .’

I noticed that my previous good-luck message hadn’t been read, and that she hadn’t checked WhatsApp for over a day, but knowing Lilith needed total rest, I wasn’t that worried.

By about three, the girls appeared to be building a nest out of blankets under the dining-room table, and taking what felt like every toy in the house to join them. My lethargy had returned and I’d given up trying to redirect the game to something more contained. Instead, I lay on the couch reading a book and occasionally, irrelevantly, yelling, ‘Careful!’

At some point Sean called to say that he had to work late, and might take a potential investor out to supper after the meeting. I just felt relieved that I didn’t have to cook; I could fob the girls off with sandwiches, which I did a little later, and tried to bring bedtime earlier than usual.

But Ruby was restless and didn’t want to go to sleep. ‘One more sleep, Becca?’ she said.

‘Yes,’ I assured her. ‘Tomorrow Mommy’s coming to fetch Ruby.’

‘Sure?’

‘Very sure.’

This conversation was repeated every time she started nodding off – she’d jerk her head up and ask again. In the end I think she fell asleep from sheer exhaustion, and I was exhausted too.

I didn’t manage to stay up for Sean, and didn’t even hear him getting into bed.

When Ruby woke up screaming in the early hours of the morning, Sean and I both went to her.

‘How’d it go?’ I whispered to him as I rocked her.

‘Good, but nothing solid,’ he said, stroking Ruby’s back. ‘You? Everything okay here?’

‘Ruby was a bit restless,’ I said. ‘She seems anxious about Lilith fetching her.’

‘Funny thing,’ said Sean. ‘I bet Lilith is counting the minutes to see her lovely girl.’

I smiled. ‘She probably is.’

Sean nodded and left, careful to be quiet. I stayed with Ruby until she fell asleep again, thinking how we’d miss her when she went home. She’d so quickly felt like part of the family.

I sighed. Maybe I did need another child to feel complete. Maybe tomorrow would be the day Clarissa phoned with some news.

# Wednesday

This was the plan: I would fetch the girls from school, and let Lilith know when we were home. Lilith expected to be discharged by that time, and would fetch Ruby-Mae immediately. If, for some reason, Lilith didn’t hear from me, she would assume that we’d be home by two in the afternoon, and would come through anyway.

And this is what really happened:

I fetched the girls from school at 12.30pm.

‘Where’s my mommy?’ asked Ruby as soon as she saw me.

‘She’s not back yet, Ruby,’ I said. ‘Just now. After lunch.’

But I immediately sent Lilith a WhatsApp: ‘Heading home with girls. See you soon?’ I couldn’t help noticing that my previous messages were unread, and that Lilith’s status reflected that she’d last checked her messages on Sunday afternoon at 4pm.

I got the girls home and gave them lunch. Ruby was fretting, and I felt a twinge of worry. Surely Lilith should be back on her phone by now?

I called her number and it went straight to voicemail: ‘Lilith, we’re all ready for you. Give me a call if there’s a problem.’

As I put the phone down, I realised what must have happened – it was so obvious and also exactly the reason why we had the back-up plan of 2pm. Her battery must have died and being Lilith, she’d forgotten the charger. I chuckled: she’d packed a huge case for Ruby but she had still managed to forget a phone charger for herself.

‘Mommy will be here soon,’ I told Ruby.

But 2pm came and went, and Lilith didn’t come. My nerves were on high alert and I jumped at the sound of every passing car. The next one had to be Lilith, every time. And even though I knew it was pointless, between 2pm and 3pm I left three more voice messages.

‘Where’s Mommy?’ said Ruby, and I was so grateful that she couldn’t tell the time. ‘Soon baby,’ I said. ‘Soon.’

By four, I was really starting to get irritated. I checked the phone again, but my messages were still unread and it still went to voicemail. All I could think was that there had been some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe she’d meant next Wednesday? Or changed the day? I didn’t mind at all if we had Ruby-Mae a bit longer; I just needed to find out what was happening. Partly, for my own peace of mind, but mostly because I wanted to know what to tell Ruby-Mae. Not for the first time, I felt so frustrated that we all only have each other’s cellphone numbers. It’s all very well until someone forgets their charger at home.

Think laterally, I told myself. How else could I get hold of Lilith? What would I have done in the days before cellphones? Put like that, the answer was obvious. I looked up the number for the Sandton Clinic, the hospital she’d told me she was going to.

‘Has Lilith Browne checked out yet?’ I asked the woman who answered. I realised I was making it sound like a hotel. ‘I mean, been discharged.’

‘Hang on,’ said the woman. After a few minutes of elevator music, she came back. ‘Please spell,’ she said.

I spelt ‘Browne’, emphasising the ‘e’, and ‘Lilith’ and then, when she couldn’t find anyone, I suggested she look under ‘Brown’ without an ‘e’. And maybe ‘Lili’.

‘The last person with the surname ‘Brown’ on my system was Mr Edgar Jonas Brown, no “e”,’ said the woman. ‘He was discharged on Saturday.’

I must have misunderstood which hospital she was at, I thought, but that was okay because I remembered the name of their GP. So I looked up his number and called. I explained to the receptionist that I was looking for information on a patient who the doctor had checked in to hospital, and who was now late to fetch her child. Dr Schmidt called me back within ten minutes.

‘Shireen explained your call to me,’ he said. ‘But there must be a misunderstanding. I haven’t seen Lilith Browne for about six months.’

‘What?’ I said. ‘No, that can’t be right.’

‘I can’t really tell you much more without breaking patient confidentiality at this point,’ he said. ‘But. Well, if she doesn’t turn up, get your lawyer to give me a call.’

‘*What*?’ I said.

‘Just saying. Just in case. Never know. Sure it’ll be fine.’ He spoke so quickly the sentences snowballed over each other.

‘Do you know something that I should know?’ I said, choosing my words. ‘I’ve got her child here with me.’

‘Gotta go. Let me know.’ And he hung up.

I tried Lilith’s phone again. Voicemail.

Then I tried her office number. A woman’s voice answered the phone, taking me by surprise because I hadn’t thought through what I was going to say. ‘Um, hi, I’m looking for Lilith,’ I said.

‘Sick leave,’ said the woman. ‘Although we’re starting to wonder.’

‘What do you mean?’ I asked. ‘She’s only been off for two days.’

‘More like two months,’ said the woman. ‘Keeps telling us she’ll be back soon, but no sight so far. Suits me cos I’m temping ... It’s a nice place to work – she’s nuts to walk out.’

‘Are you serious?’ But none of that made any sense. I was sure that there was some misunderstanding, that this temp woman had things backwards somehow. I put down the phone and tried Lilith’s phone again. Voicemail.

‘Where’s my mommy?’ said Ruby, coming up next to me.

I looked at her pale face, framed by Lilith’s fly-away blonde hair.

‘I think maybe we had a misunderstanding, love,’ I said, thinking aloud. ‘Maybe it’s tomorrow.’

Ruby looked at her feet. ‘Mommy’s not coming,’ she said.

‘Of course she is, Ruby,’ I said, hoping I sounded reassuring. ‘She’d never leave you.’

Ruby walked slowly back to the bedroom, where she’d been playing with Amy. I watched her as she climbed onto the bed and held her teddy. Amy was playing on the floor, oblivious.

‘Gugu,’ I called, ‘watch the girls. I’m just going somewhere. And if Lilith comes, phone me *immediately*.’ I rushed past her, and then turned back and took hold of her arms. ‘Please. It’s important, Gugu. Phone me the moment she comes.’

Gugu nodded, and I kissed the girls goodbye. Amy was so engrossed in her game that she barely lifted her head to me, and Ruby just held her teddy closer.

‘I’ll be back soon,’ I said. I nearly added that I was going to find her mommy, but I stopped myself.

I drove as fast as I could to Lilith’s flat. When I got there, I parked and ran up the stairs to Lilith’s unit. I knocked on the door but there was no answer – I hadn’t really expected one. Lilith would hardly be sitting at home while we waited for her.

I felt like I should peer through a window, but the only window on the door side of the flat was frosted glass covered by a blind, which I knew was for the kitchen. There was no point trying to pretend that I’d actually see anything.

So I went downstairs – the real reason I had come – to Mrs Clarke’s sex shop.

\*\*\*

When I was younger, the people I knew had gone through a phase where we found it the biggest laugh to buy sex toys for a friend, or a porn movie, or kinky lingerie. So I’d been into sex shops before, but not for a long time. I was almost jogging as I entered the shop, but came to a halt to allow my eyes to adjust to the dim lighting. This was something I hadn’t remembered, or else Mrs Clarke’s sex shop was different from the ones I’d been to. The space I was in was lit only by red light, and seemed to be an entrance hall. Across from me were three doors, with a luminous red sign with cursive writing above each: ‘Lingerie and outfits’, ‘Movies’ and ‘Toys’. The hall was papered with a heavy red brocade, and the carpet was soft. Surprisingly, the music playing was classical.

‘So what do you think, Rebecca?’ said a voice behind me, and I started.

Eugenie Clarke lumbered forward from a desk I hadn’t noticed in an alcove near the door. Next to the desk was a chaise longue.

‘It’s ...’ I struggled to find the words without giving offence. So I just said what I thought. ‘It’s classy. I hadn’t expected that. It makes me want to look further.’

Eugenie laughed, her great breasts heaving. ‘Well, go ahead, my dear. Don’t let me stop you.’

My cold panic flooded back.

‘Mrs Clarke, Eugenie,’ I said, ‘I came to ask if you’ve seen Lilith. Ruby-Mae is staying at us, and Lilith was supposed to fetch her by two today.’

Eugenie Clarke raised her plucked eyebrows. ‘It’s not like Lilith to be late to fetch Ruby-Mae,’ she said.

‘No,’ I said, then stopped. ‘Although to be honest, this is not the first time. But it’s different – Ruby’s been with us since Monday morning. I thought Lilith would be bursting to see her. And the doctor has stopped seeing Lilith and the hospital doesn’t know anything about her.’

‘Doctor? Hospital? What are you talking about?’

So I started to explain, trying to keep calm, trying to remember. When I reached the part about Lilith being so exhausted and sick that she had to check into hospital, Mrs Clarke sat down on the chaise longue, causing an ominous sigh from its joints.

‘I knew that girl was sick,’ she said. ‘But I had no idea.’

‘That’s the thing,’ I said. ‘Neither do the hospital or the doctor. I have no idea where she actually went. I have no idea where she is.’

I reached into my bag and pulled out my cellphone, almost shaking it at Mrs Clarke. ‘She doesn’t answer. She hasn’t read my messages.’

With a creak of her knees, Eugenie Clarke stood up, pushing herself off the chaise longue with one hand. ‘Give me a second,’ she said.

She touched a switch on the wall, and suddenly the foyer was flooded with light. The sense of mystery evaporated, and the worn paths on the carpets became visible. There was a patch on the chaise longue that needed darning. Mrs Clarke checked what appeared to be a bank of security screens behind her desk, and sighed. ‘Oh, not him. He’s so hard to shift.’

She went through the door marked ‘Movies’, and I heard her explaining to someone that the shop was briefly closing due to a family emergency.

‘But you never close,’ retorted a whiny male voice.

‘Well, I’m closing now, so move it,’ said Mrs Clarke.

I was expecting her to be accompanied by a seedy sort of man, possibly in a raincoat, but the man who strode out was tall and good-looking, in an expensive suit, like some sort of captain of industry. He glared at me as he walked out.

‘Perv,’ said Mrs Clarke, with no apparent sense of irony, as she closed the door after him. Then she turned back to me. ‘I have Lilith’s keys,’ she said. ‘I think we should see if we can find anything in the flat.’

Despite the fact that not ten minutes before, I’d been wanting to press my nose to the windowpanes, I now felt strange violating Lilith’s privacy.

‘Should we really do this?’ I said to Eugenie as we walked back up the stairs to Lilith’s flat. ‘She could just be stuck in traffic with a dead cellphone.’

‘Two things,’ said Eugenie. ‘Traffic from where? And she could use a public phone like we all did back in the day.’

‘Back in the day, when we actually knew each other’s phone numbers by heart,’ I countered.

‘True,’ agreed Eugenie, unlocking Lilith’s door. She pushed it open, revealing the familiar bright space of Lilith’s flat.

The first thing I saw was Lilith’s phone lying on the small white dining-room table.

I blinked, but nothing changed. Next to it was a piece of paper with Lilith’s distinctive writing:

I’m sorry.

\[digi note: letter\]

And that was all.

Eugenie and I stood next to each other, looking down at the note. Eugenie’s bulk seemed to support me, because I was weak, like someone had dissolved my bones.

‘It could mean anything,’ said Eugenie, her voice coming from far away.

‘Yes,’ I said, but my voice was so soft I don’t think she heard me. I cleared my throat and tried to speak again, but Eugenie was striding away from me to the little passage that led to the bedrooms. Without her beside me, I needed to grip the table.

‘Good God, it looks like all Ruby-Mae’s clothes are gone,’ she called out. ‘I thought you said she was just with you for two days?’

I wanted to follow Eugenie, but I couldn’t. I pulled out a chair and sat down as she banged closed more cupboard doors.

‘I think they’re all with me,’ I said, my voice barely a whisper. ‘And Lilith always over-packs. Even for the park.’

‘Well, wherever she is, *she* hasn’t over-packed,’ said Eugenie, who’d somehow heard me from Lilith’s bedroom. ‘Most of her stuff seems to be here.’

I felt a slight lifting of my panic – that was consistent with her going to hospital.

‘Her toiletries aren’t here though,’ called Eugenie. ‘And I’m guessing some underwear and nighties, because there are some almost empty drawers.’

‘Makes sense,’ I said, my voice unexpectedly booming. ‘For hospital,’ I added, at a more normal volume.

‘But she didn’t go to the hospital,’ said Eugenie, reappearing at the doorway to the passage, ‘did she?’

‘Maybe I misunderstood. Maybe she’s at another hospital.’

Eugenie rubbed her hand across her cleavage. ‘Good point,’ she said. ‘We’ll just have to phone them all.’

‘I need to get back to the girls,’ I said.

‘Are you okay keeping Ruby-Mae tonight?’ she asked.

‘I promise, having Ruby is not the problem,’ I said.

‘Well then, let’s leave it for tonight – maybe Lilith will find a way to call you, or realise that you must be panicking.’ We both glanced at the cellphone and the note on the table. ‘I’ll come by to your place tomorrow, and we can call all the hospitals and anything else while the girls are at school.’

I liked that: a good plan. I felt calmer.

‘I’ll be back home by nine,’ I said. I gave her my address and phone number, and then headed back home to the waiting children.

In the car, I tried to think out logically what could have happened, but it was almost as if my mind couldn’t go there. My thoughts became a blur of white noise and my hands started to sweat. I had no idea what was going in, and none of the options bore thinking about.

When I got back home, Gugu had the girls eating supper in front if the TV. I could have hugged her. We stood at the door together for a moment.

‘She’s gone,’ said Gugu, her voice flat.

‘Lilith?’ I said. ‘Well, she’s missing.’

‘She’s gone,’ repeated Gugu. ‘This happens.’

‘Oh really, Gugu,’ I said, because I was actually at a total loss of what else to say. But her words tipped me over the edge again. I phoned Sean.

‘We’ve got a bit of a situation here,’ I said. ‘Lilith hasn’t pitched to fetch Ruby-Mae, and we don’t actually know where she is.’ I filled him in on what I’d done, that Ruby would be staying another night, and that Eugenie was coming to help me the next morning.

‘Okay,’ he said. ‘Because maybe you misunderstood, right? Maybe she’s actually fetching her tomorrow.’

‘Maybe,’ I said. ‘I’m just worried because she wasn’t in the hospital and has obviously been lying to me.’

‘It’s not like she’d just leave Ruby-Mae with us and never come back,’ said Sean with a laugh. ‘Obviously there’s been a misunderstanding or some unforeseen situation. You’ll find her at another hospital with another doctor, and we’ll laugh about this, right?’

‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘You’re probably right.’

But when I put the phone down, Gugu was still watching me.

‘She’s gone,’ she said.

‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ I said. But my heart wasn’t in it.

For now at least, Lilith was gone.

# Thursday

On Thursday morning, before Sean left for work, he spent some time cuddling Ruby-Mae.

‘I know you’re worried, sweetie,’ he said. ‘But we’ll find out why Mommy was so late, and she’ll be here soon. And Rebecca and I love you, so you mustn’t be worried.’

Ruby-Mae rested her head against his chest. ‘I want my mommy,’ she said.

‘I know, baby,’ he said. ‘I know.’

He looked worried when he left a little while later.

‘Keep me updated, okay, love?’

‘Sure,’ I said. ‘I’m taking the girls to school and then Eugenie will be here. I’m sure we’ll find her.’

He must have heard the doubt in my voice. ‘Rebecca,’ he said, taking hold of my upper arms. ‘You will find her. This is just a misunderstanding. Got it?’

I nodded. ‘Got it.’

He kissed me and turned to go. Then he turned back. ‘Rebecca, phone Lerato. Just kind of fill her in. In case we need a lawyer.’

I wanted to ask him why we would need a lawyer if it was all just a misunderstanding. But I already felt exhausted. ‘Okay,’ was all I said.

Sean nodded and looked at me. ‘Phone me,’ he said one final time, and left.

I took the girls to school, and Maureen raised her eyebrows when she saw that I still had Ruby with me.

‘There’s been a misunderstanding,’ I said. ‘It seems that Ruby-Mae is still with us.’

Maureen looked at me. ‘Till when?’ she said.

‘I’m not sure.’

‘I’m just going to have to phone Lilith and confirm,’ she said.

I rubbed my forehead. ‘Maureen, I can’t get hold of Lilith and I can’t find her,’ I said softly, so that Amy and Ruby wouldn’t hear me. ‘If you can get hold of Lilith, nobody will be happier than me.’

Maureen looked taken aback. ‘Okay,’ she said. ‘Well, I’ll try.’

I nodded. She obviously didn’t understand exactly how hard I’d tried already, and I didn’t have the energy to explain it to her.

‘You do that,’ I said.

At home, I tried Lilith’s number again. Voicemail. Although I knew that already, because her phone was sitting, battery dead, in her flat.

Eugenie arrived on time, looking flustered.

‘I’ve barely slept,’ she said. ‘I have such a bad feeling about this.’

‘It’s bound to be a misunderstanding.’ My voice sounded mechanical, even to me.

‘Well, then you and I have both misunderstood a whole lot of stuff,’ said Eugenie. ‘We must both be very stupid.’

‘Okay,’ I said, relieved that I could let go of the pretence. ‘It’s not a misunderstanding. But I’m sure there’s still a really good explanation.’

Eugenie looked at me for a long moment, her hand resting on her generous cleavage. ‘Okay,’ she said, after what felt like an aeon. ‘Let’s work on that presumption and sort this out.’

We sat down, each with a paper and pen, and brainstormed every hospital in Joburg. Then we googled to check if we’d missed anything.

‘Maybe,’ I said as we were doing this, ‘maybe she had to go to a state hospital and was too embarrassed to tell us that she couldn’t afford private. That would explain everything.’

‘Everything?’ said Eugenie.

I thought about Ruby-Mae holding on to Sean the night before, not knowing where her mother was. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘it would explain a lot.’

We split the list of hospitals between us, and both started phoning – going through all possible spellings of Browne each time, and at the state hospitals being transferred from department to department while they tried to figure out who could actually tell us what patients were or weren’t there.

By eleven we had both finished our lists.

‘So there’s nothing,’ said Eugenie, her hand worrying her cleavage. ‘Not in any of the local private or public hospitals, unless she’s under another name.’

‘Why would she do that?’ I asked.

‘Why would she have done any of this, Rebecca?’

‘Fair point,’ I said. ‘What next?’

‘I’m going to go to Johannesburg Hospital,’ she said after a pause. ‘I think your idea about her being embarrassed about being in a public hospital is the most likely explanation, and I’m not sure they really knew what they were doing on the phone.’

‘Okay,’ I said. I liked letting her take control.

‘If I find nothing, I’ll come back here. And then ...’ Her voice fizzled out.

‘And then?’ I echoed.

‘Well, let’s see what happens.’

Eugenie left, and after trying to paint with absolutely no success, I phoned Sean and filled him in.

‘Okay,’ he said. ‘Okay.’ But I could hear that it wasn’t okay. He’d stopped talking about misunderstandings.

‘If she finds nothing,’ he eventually said, ‘call me. I’ll come home.’

By then it was time to fetch the girls. As I drove to the school, I wondered what I could do with them while we waited for Eugenie. Something to keep all our minds off Lilith. At the back of my mind, I felt like I’d had something planned for this Thursday afternoon, so as I pulled up to the school, I checked the calendar on my phone.

Oh hell, I thought: the doctor’s appointment.

I considered cancelling it. Compared to what was going on, being tired was hardly urgent. But the thought of dialling the number and speaking to the receptionist and then rescheduling just seemed like more effort than actually going. So I decided to keep the appointment.

After our usual post-school greeting ceremony, I loaded the girls into the car, grateful that Ruby wasn’t asking about Lilith, and took them home to Gugu. I texted Eugenie that I was going to the doctor, but that she should come back to us anyway when she was done, and I told the girls that I was leaving them with Gugu for a bit. It felt like a treat, allowing myself to stop worrying about Lilith for the next hour. But, by the time I actually left, I was feeling exhausted again and queasy – my tummy once again in the knot I’d started to feel when Lilith had failed to arrive. I was glad I hadn’t cancelled the appointment.

\*\*\*

Melanie Malcolm has been my doctor since Sean and I moved to the area. She’s looked after all our aches and pains over the years; she watched me go through my fertility hopes, dreams, battles and losses and, when I finally became a parent, she started looking after Amy too.

Our appointments always start with a catch-up session.

Mel’s opening words were surprising. ‘You look so well, Rebecca,’ she said. ‘Life with Amy must be agreeing with you.’

I looked at her carefully, wondering if she’d lost her mind. ‘I feel,’ I started, ‘I feel like the end of the world, I’m so tired. One of my friends has had a really bad virus, and I’m scared I also have it. But also, I’m not scared, because I just want to sleep.’

‘Any big changes, stresses lately?’ asked Mel, pulling her notes towards her. ‘Give me a bit of a picture of where your life is at.’

‘We tried IVF again and it failed,’ I said. Mel raised her eyebrows and made a note in her doctor’s scrawl. ‘That was a bit upsetting. But now we’re trying to adopt again, and that’s great, but it’s stressful waiting to hear something. Oh, and my friend Lilith – the one with the virus – has disappeared, leaving her daughter with me. She was supposed to fetch her yesterday, and now we can’t find her anywhere.’

Mel raised her eyebrows. ‘Lots going on,’ she said, making another note. ‘I’m not surprised you’re tired.’

‘But I’ve been through worse,’ I said. ‘And I’ve never felt like this.’

‘You didn’t have a toddler then,’ said Mel. ‘Everything is a bit worse when you have a toddler. But let’s not rule anything out yet. Tell me about the friend?’

I told her what little I knew about Lilith’s illness and the hospital rest she was supposed to have, and how she’d now disappeared.

‘God, how weird. Even the medical part doesn’t make sense,’ said Mel. ‘Are you sure it’s not psychiatric?’

I was about to completely deny the possibility, but I had to admit that Lilith wasn’t one of the top five mentally stable people I knew.

‘But she’s been looking terrible,’ I said to Mel. ‘Really sick. Physically. And she sleeps all the time.’

‘Hmm. So the IVF,’ continued Mel. ‘When was that?’

I did a mental calculation. ‘Um, about three months ago we started,’ I said. ‘So we found out I wasn’t pregnant about eight or nine weeks ago, I think.’

She made a note. ‘Everything back to normal physically since then?’ she asked.

‘Other than this exhaustion, I think so,’ I said. ‘I was a bit low afterwards, but I think that’s got better since we decided to adopt again.’

‘Periods normal?’

‘Yes,’ I started to say, and then stopped. ‘Well, I was very regular before the IVF. And then obviously I had a period after the IVF. And then ...’ My brain scrambled. I knew logically that there must have been another period, but I honestly couldn’t remember. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I don’t actually know when the last one was, but it must have happened.’

Mel put down her pen and pushed her glasses up her nose. ‘Any nausea?’ she said.

‘Yes!’ I said. ‘How did you know?’

I looked at her and she raised her expressive eyebrows. With what felt like a wave of cold through my body, I realised what she was thinking. Mostly, I felt mortified for her that she could be so wrong.

‘No, Mel,’ I said. ‘I’m not.’

‘There’s a phenomena of people getting pregnant the cycle after an IVF, as I’m sure you know,’ she said.

I laughed. ‘No, Mel, the doctors just tell you that to stop you from killing yourself,’ I explained. ‘It’s not something that actually happens to people.’

‘I suspect a few learned studies would disagree with you,’ said Mel with a smile. ‘But I take your point that you’ve spent many years trying to get pregnant and gone through a lot of IVF, so it’s unlikely that you’re pregnant.’

‘Exactly,’ I said. ‘I have a virus.’

‘Most likely,’ agreed Mel, and it was hard not to feel that her tone was placating. ‘Still,’ she continued. ‘There’s this rule that I was taught: Assume every woman is pregnant, and every pregnancy is ectopic, before you rule anything out. So, for the sake of my own ethics, can we do a pregnancy test?’

I looked at Mel. This was a total waste of time, and I couldn’t believe she was quite so naïve.

‘See it as a bet,’ she said. ‘If you’re not pregnant, you don’t pay for the test.’ She was already preparing a syringe.

I shrugged, and held out my arm for the blood test.

Mel put the blood on a stick much like a urine test, and while we waited she did a full examination: my heart (normal), blood pressure (slightly high), throat (bit red), nose (slightly runny, clear mucus), ears (fine), glands (fine), breasts (no lumps), lungs (clear) and temperature (normal). She smiled as she examined me, and we made small talk about Amy and Sean and the weather, and I tried to tell her a bit more about Lilith’s disappearance. I was honestly barely thinking about the pregnancy test sitting like a time bomb on the counter, except to wonder slightly at Mel’s failure to properly grasp my infertility.

After the examination, she asked me to get dressed, and went back through the door of the examination room, picking up the pregnancy test as she passed, and glancing down. I couldn’t see her face, and she didn’t make a sound, but I knew she’d be feeling foolish to have done the test at all. I felt a bit sorry for her, actually, and vindicated that I knew my body so well.

I went through to the office a few minutes later, still fastening the buttons of my jersey. ‘So,’ I said, sitting across from her, ‘what do you think’s wrong with me?’

Wordlessly, Mel slid the test over her desk. She knew how many I’d seen and done in my life; she knew I needed no instruction. And she knew that I’d never before seen a test like this one, with a little positive cross where there was usually a single line of sorrow.

I picked it up and looked at it, and then looked up at her for confirmation.

She nodded, and I swear, her eyes had tears in them. ‘You’re pregnant, Rebecca,’ she said. ‘You’re so definitely pregnant that I didn’t really need the test to know.’

‘But ...’ I said, ‘but I can’t be.’

‘As it turns out,’ said Mel, ‘you can. I’m guessing you’re about seven or eight weeks along.’

I left Mel’s office with a pamphlet on pregnancy, a script for folic acid supplements (and instructions to start them immediately), instructions to make an urgent appointment with my gynae for a scan (‘You should be able to hear a heart beat by now’) and reassurance that the fatigue would eventually pass. I paid as if in a dream and, clutching all the bits of paper to my chest, walked slowly to my car.

In the car, I couldn’t formulate my thoughts. My brain couldn’t get itself around this piece of information, this piece of information that I had finally and absolutely resigned myself to never owning – that I was growing a baby inside my body, all on my own.

I almost phoned Sean from the car. But we’d waited so long for this to happen to us that I thought it deserved a personal delivery. Also, it would be such a shock to him. I wanted to see his reaction. I considered going to his office, but then remembered that Eugenie was expecting to find me at home. I wasn’t sure how I was going to hide my euphoria – euphoria that was completely inappropriate in the face of Lilith’s disappearance – but I knew I would have to: Sean needed to be the first person I told.

The only thing I did before I went home was phone the gynae to make an appointment for a scan. At first the receptionist told me that I’d have to wait three weeks, but when I told her who I was, and what had happened, she suddenly had an appointment available for me the very next morning. I suddenly understood why the wait at the gynaecologist could be hours after the appointment time, but I wasn’t going to complain when it was working in my favour.

\*\*\*

Eugenie and I arrived at my house at almost exactly the same time. I gave my tummy a fond stroke, then composed my face and climbed out of the car. Eugenie hauled herself out of her own car.

‘Anything?’ I asked.

Eugenie shook her head. She looked exhausted; her eyes were underlined with dark shadows and her face looked like it had slipped slightly from its moorings.

‘Cup of tea, I think,’ I said, putting an arm around her and leading her into the house.

As Eugenie and I came in the front door, Amy and Ruby walked through from the TV room holding hands. Amy hadn’t let Ruby out of reach since the first signs that Lilith was not going to arrive as expected.

‘Clarkie!’ yelled Ruby, letting go of Amy and hurling herself towards Eugenie. ‘Did you bringed my mommy?’

Eugenie caught Ruby and held her in her arms while she stroked her hair. ‘No, babe,’ she said. ‘Clarkie’s not too sure where Mommy is. But I know that wherever she is, she’s thinking of her Ruby-Mae.’

It was exactly the right thing to say, and I envied Eugenie suddenly. Ruby wrapped her arms as far around Eugenie as they would go, and leant her head against one enormous boob. ‘Boobie,’ she said, in case anyone was unsure. But she sounded peaceful.

As I watched them, my phone rang. It was Sean, wanting to know if we’d had any luck.

‘Nothing,’ I said.

‘Have you phoned Lerato yet?’

‘No.’

‘Okay, phone her. I’m coming home.’

‘Sean,’ I started, somehow needing him on the line, even though I wasn’t going to tell him about the baby. But he’d already rung off.

Eugenie entertained the girls by dancing with them – an unexpectedly graceful sight – while I first tried to phone Lerato, and settled on leaving a voice message. And then sending a WhatsApp. And a text message.

Eugenie smiled at me. ‘I think you’ve covered every base there.’

I laughed; Eugenie Clark was proving to be unexpectedly comforting.

I joined the dancing, and Eugenie and I first tried to teach the girls to do some ballet steps, and then to waltz. In an attempt to explain the steps, we found ourselves waltzing with each other – and began to laugh so hard we almost had to prop each other up.

Sean walked in on this scene, and looked at Eugenie with undisguised curiosity.

‘Eugenie Clarke. My husband, Sean,’ I introduced them. ‘Sean, I told you about Eugenie. Eugenie owns a sex shop.’

I don’t know why I thought this was the most important piece of information to pass on; I must have been more tired and rattled than I realised.

Sean shook hands with Eugenie. ‘I’m sure it’ll become clear to me why we need a sex shop at this juncture, but nice to meet you in the meantime.’

Eugenie and I both laughed, and Sean joined in despite having no idea what was going on. I asked Gugu to take the girls for a bath, muttering that she’d be paid for all this overtime, and then the three of us sat down in the kitchen as Eugenie and I told Sean what we knew.

Sean was still for a moment and then looked at me. ‘Go and look in that suitcase Lilith brought,’ he said.

‘What?’

‘The bag she packed for Ruby. Go and look what’s in it.’

‘Okay,’ I said, unsure how taking a tally of Ruby’s clothes was going to help, but unsure what else to do.

I pulled the bag out from where I’d hidden it under Ruby’s bed, and opened it. I took out the remaining clothes – which I now realised were the bulk of Ruby’s wardrobe. Under the clothes was a layer of toys, and under the toys, the blanket Lilith had mentioned in her letter. I sighed. Then a thought caught, and I slowly lifted the blanket. Underneath the blanket was a layer of newspaper. My hands shook slightly as I removed the newspaper, folding it carefully as if I might need it again.

At the bottom of the suitcase was a transparent Flip File and a photo album. I picked up the Flip File and began to turn the pages.

In it was Ruby’s birth certificate (father marked unknown, I noticed), her vaccination records, a section that seemed to be of early school reports, a receipt for the years’ fees from our school and some letters from private primary schools reflecting that Ruby’s name was on their lists. The photo album was a thick one. The first photo was an out-of-focus picture of a far fatter, pregnant Lilith. I flipped through and discovered a photographic history of Ruby’s life so far. The last photograph looked like a recent studio portrait of Lilith and Ruby, their blonde heads touching, their blue eyes sparkling.

I picked up the file and photo album, walked through to the kitchen and put them on the table. Wordlessly, Sean looked at the Flip File, and then pushed it over to Eugenie.

‘She’s run off and left Ruby-Mae with us,’ said Sean, his calm voice belied by the fingers raking through his hair.

‘She would never leave Ruby-Mae,’ I hissed, scared that the little girl would hear. ‘Never.’

Eugenie and Sean glanced at each other, allies already.

‘I think she’s been planning this for a while,’ said Sean.

I was about to deny this, remind them how much Lilith loves Ruby, but I paused. I was back at that day in the park when I lost Lilith. I was back at the first time Ruby-Mae spent the night and Lilith was late.

And in a glimpse I saw that I might need to rewrite Lilith and my history. Or perhaps reread what had always been written.

‘But why?’ I eventually managed. ‘Lilith loves Ruby-Mae. She wouldn’t do this.’

I felt, unfairly perhaps, that Sean and Eugenie weren’t mothers; that they couldn’t understand. I knew that Lilith wouldn’t just walk away from her daughter.

‘She wouldn’t do this,’ Eugenie said slowly, ‘unless she got it into her head that it was best for Ruby-Mae. She’d have a good reason. Sometimes mothers make hard choices.’ Something in her voice made me realise that my assumption that Eugenie was not a mother was just that, and that maybe she understood better than I thought. Maybe she understood better than me.

‘Why would she think that?’ I asked.

‘I don’t know,’ said Eugenie. ‘I don’t know what would make Lilith think that leaving Ruby-Mae would be best. But I can see why she’d want to leave her with you two.’

‘And even if all this is true,’ said Sean, ‘why wouldn’t she explain? Why wouldn’t she ask us?’

‘I can see why she wouldn’t have asked,’ Eugenie said. ‘You might have said no. Most people would. And if you did that now, I certainly wouldn’t blame you.’ She paused and put her hands flat in front of her on the table, gazing reflectively at them as if they held the answers. ‘But I don’t understand why there isn’t a letter. Some sort of explanation.’

We were all silent for a moment, wondering what that letter would have said.

‘This is all very well,’ said Sean, ‘but the question is what happens next. I’m thinking we should be filing a missing persons report or something with the police. Whatever has happened, we need to find Lilith and speak to her. We can help her with whatever she’s going through. Help her see that nothing is worth abandoning Ruby. Maybe it’s money. Maybe we can help her with money. But we need to find her. We need to go to the police.’

It seemed so obvious. It seemed as if that should have been my first step, and I felt wrong-footed.

‘But I don’t think we should do that before talking to a lawyer,’ said Sean. ‘That’s why I wanted Lerato.’

‘Why do we need a lawyer? Do you think they’ll think we murdered her?’ I asked.

Sean looked at me. ‘No, Rebecca. I’m worried that they might take Ruby-Mae away from us. Obviously, we don’t want that. We’ll find Lilith and sort this out, but in the meantime, Ruby is safest with us.’

My eyes filled with tears – not at the thought of losing Ruby-Mae (that would come), but at the fact that my husband hadn’t even questioned that Ruby-Mae should stay with us. Sean reached for my hand, and took it. He turned slightly and gave me a searching look.

‘Right?’ he said.

‘Right,’ I answered, squeezing his hand. ‘Right.’

As if summoned by our decision, my phone rang. I glanced at the screen and saw it was Lerato.

‘Talk of,’ I said, showing Sean.

I answered, and Lerato barely let me get through ‘hello’ before she started speaking. ‘Got your messages. Spoke to some peeps. On my way. Don’t call the police.’

‘Um, okay,’ I said. ‘Great.’

Lerato rung off before I had a chance to say anything more, and then Gugu appeared at the door. ‘The girls are ready to sleep,’ she said. ‘But they want you, Rebecca.’

‘Poor little things,’ said Sean. ‘They must be so confused.’ He turned to Gugu. ‘Thank you so much for everything, Gugu. I think you’d better go home – tomorrow will be another long day, I’m guessing.’

I felt a flush of love for Sean as I walked to Amy’s room, where two clean and pyjamaed children awaited me, both sitting on their beds holding their teddies. Ruby’s teddy was the one I had unpacked on the first day of her stay. Amy’s was one that Sean’s sister had brought the first day Amy was with us. It had actually been languishing at the bottom of her toy box for two years, but Ruby’s attachment to a teddy bear had triggered the idea in Amy’s head that she also needed one, and Susan’s present, among the many contenders, had won the coveted role.

‘Look, Becca,’ said Ruby. ‘All the toys been done come.’ She indicated a shelf, where Gugu had, amongst everything else, tidied away the toys that I’d flung around the room when I’d unpacked Ruby’s bag.

‘Yes,’ I said to Ruby. ‘I guess they missed you.’

It was the wrong thing to say.

‘I miss my mommy,’ said Ruby. She put her head down on her teddy’s.

I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arms around her, enveloping both child and toy. ‘I know, baby,’ I said. ‘We’re doing everything we can to figure out what’s going on here. But you’re safe, and we love you, and we can talk about how you are feeling any time you want.’

I felt Ruby’s head nod against my shoulder. ‘Ruby be’s a good girl.’

‘You’re always a good girl, sweetie,’ I said, kissing the little blonde head. ‘But if you need to cry or be sad, or even if you need to shout and be cross, that’s okay.’

‘Mommy,’ said Amy, from her perch on her own pillow, ‘can I also be cross? Can I growl like this?’ She made growly lion hands and emitted a sound that was half growl and half shriek. I was about to admonish her when I felt Ruby laughing against my chest.

‘That’s a scary growl,’ I said instead.

‘And I can growl like this,’ Amy carried on, making a small squeak.

Ruby laughed and pushed herself away from me.

I took the opening. ‘Let’s read a story,’ I said, grabbing a book from the pile next to the bed, and lying down in the middle of them, where the two single beds were pushed together. Both girls cuddled against me, and within a few minutes both were sound asleep.

I extricated myself from the tangle of children and made my way back to the others.

In the time I’d been with the girls, Lerato had arrived with takeaway pizzas, which were keeping warm in the oven. A bottle of wine was open, and Eugenie Clarke looked like she was installed on the couch for the rest of eternity. Lerato was next to her and they were leaning slightly towards each other, like tipsy, mismatched bookends. I found the sight of them oddly comforting.

Sean put a glass of wine in my hand and I sipped at it gratefully. Then Lerato fetched me a piece of pizza.

‘So?’ I said, sitting down with my food and drink. ‘Where are we?’

‘After I got your message, I phoned a friend,’ said Lerato. ‘An expert in family law. I’ve made an appointment for you to see her tomorrow.’

‘That seems a bit ... hasty,’ I said. ‘Lilith could still turn up.’

Eugenie nodded, but Lerato and Sean both shook their heads.

‘We need to make sure Ruby is safe until we find Lilith,’ said Sean. ‘When we find her, we’ll sort all this out. But Ruby mustn’t be put in a foster home – that would be a disaster. We need to make sure we keep her.’

When I spoke again, I felt as if each word had to be forced from somewhere deep inside me. ‘Sean, I think she’s tried to leave her before. But she’s always changed her mind. And she might change it again.’

Sean nodded. ‘Maybe,’ he said. ‘I’ve been wondering about that.’

‘And what if we can’t find her?’ I asked him. ‘What then?’

‘We’ll find her. People can’t just disappear. But, meantime, Ruby stays with us.’

I nodded and turned to Lerato. ‘Must we report Lilith’s disappearance to the police?’

‘Yes,’ said Lerato. ‘But Marilyn said you must first try find a private social worker.’

‘Clarissa,’ Sean and I said together.

Lerato looked nonplussed for a moment. ‘Marilyn thought that would be the hard part,’ she said.

‘Nope.’ I laughed at the absurdity. ‘We’ve pretty much got a private social worker on speed dial.’

‘Well then,’ said Lerato, ‘you need to speak to her, and if possible take her with you to the police. The police need to understand that Ruby-Mae is safe with you and doesn’t need to be taken to a place of safety.’

‘Would they do that?’ Eugenie was aghast.

‘Marilyn said it’s actually unlikely,’ Lerato replied. ‘That it’d probably just be too much trouble for them. But she also said you might get one policeman with his wits about him, and then you need to be able to show that the child is safe.’

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘So first thing tomorrow, we phone Clarissa. And then we go to the police. And then we see a lawyer.’ I sighed. ‘I still think this is some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe we should just wait a week.’

‘We can,’ said Sean. ‘But it won’t change. We may as well go tomorrow. First thing.’

An ice-cold wave of realisation hit, and I put down the wine glass I’d been nursing, despite it being long empty. I stared at it for a moment. I couldn’t believe I’d forgotten.

I hadn’t been pregnant for a day, and I was already drinking.

‘I can’t do it tomorrow,’ I said, my voice almost breaking. ‘I’ve got a gynae appointment.’

Sean looked at me. ‘For God’s sake, Rebecca, under the circumstances I think you can cancel it. This is a bit more important.’

‘No,’ I said, slowly lifting my head, my eyes locking with his. ‘No, this appointment is pretty important too.’ I paused, and swallowed. Never in my life had I imagined that I would give this news in these circumstances. ‘I’m pregnant, Sean,’ I said, and I started to cry.

# Friday

The next morning ran like a military operation.

First, we took the girls to school. As planned, Sean distracted them, asking them to show him their favourite toys and where their drawings were on the walls, while I took Trish and Maureen aside and briefly explained the situation. Ruby seemed fine at that moment, but I knew things were likely to change.

‘My main aim, and hopefully yours,’ I said with an authority I didn’t feel, ‘is to make Ruby feel loved and safe. I’m pretty sure she’s going to act up if we can’t find Lilith soon, and I just want us to create a safe and holding environment for her when that happens.’

I expected them to argue with me, to pit their years of experience against my shadowy theory, but they both nodded in agreement.

‘Absolutely,’ said Trish. ‘The most important thing is that we give her a place of security.’

‘Yes,’ I said, somehow wishing someone had offered a more concrete plan of action.

Back in the car, with me having accomplished the first task of the morning, we needed to get going to make my gynae appointment on time (‘Of course I’m coming,’ Sean had said). But Sean – who was driving – was just staring into space.

‘Are you okay?’ I asked.

Sean shook his head slowly. ‘I actually don’t know,’ he said. ‘I just can’t believe it,’

I almost laughed. ‘Exactly which part can’t you believe?’ I asked.

‘The whole last forty-eight hours,’ he said.

I wanted to take a moment, to talk to him and share what we were feeling, but we just didn’t have time. ‘We’ll talk more, I promise,’ I said, squeezing his hand. ‘But right now, we’ve got to move.’

While Sean drove us to the gynae, I phoned Clarissa.

‘Rebecca,’ she said, ‘I’m so glad you phoned. I was about to phone you. It’s so —’

I interrupted her. ‘Clarissa, if you’ve got a baby for us, I don’t want to know. Everything has changed, and I can’t even think about that.’

‘I’m confused, Rebecca,’ said Clarissa. ‘You’ve kind of been driving me crazy for news.’

I sighed, and started telling the story I’d get so used to telling over the course of the day that my voice would become mechanical.

‘So we need you to come to the police with us,’ I ended. ‘So you can tell them that we’ll be a safe place for Ruby to stay.’

Clarissa was quiet for a moment. ‘Okay,’ she said. ‘When?’

‘I’m just going to the doctor, and then if it’s okay, we’ll pick you up and take you with us so we can strategise in the car.’

‘The doctor?’ said Clarissa. ‘Are you sick on top of it all?’

I hadn’t wanted to tell anyone; Sean, Lerato and Eugenie seemed enough for the moment. Too much, without my mom or my brother even knowing. But I sighed, realising that this pregnancy was not, in any way, going to be how I’d imagined it.

‘I’m pregnant,’ I told Clarissa. ‘We’re going for a scan. I found out yesterday.’

‘Oh wow, honey,’ said Clarissa. ‘Congratulations. That’s just the most wonderful news.’

A fizz of pride and happiness broke through all the worry. Clarissa was the first person who’d reacted with unmitigated happiness. So far, my announcement had not led so much to congratulations as to tears (Sean’s), and confusion and embarrassment (as Eugenie and Lerato almost squashed each other in their effort to leave Sean and me alone together).

‘You just pick me up when you’re done,’ Clarissa said.

\*\*\*

I hadn’t really known what to expect from the scan that morning. I’d had what felt like a million scans before then, but they’d all been of my growing eggs or my empty uterus. And I’d seen friends’ mid-pregnancy scans of big baby-shaped blobs and close-ups that make one say, ‘How wonderful!’ even though you can’t make head or tail of the grey smudge proudly shoved under your nose.

I hadn’t realised how magical it would be.

When the scan showed a tiny bean in the space that used to be empty, and that bean had something bright and throbbing that the doctor said was its heart, I started to cry. And when Dr Stevenson turned up the volume on his machine, and we heard the baby’s heartbeat, Sean started to cry too. Not a manly shine of tears filling his eyes – he actually started to sob.

‘Sorry,’ he eventually said to Dr Stevenson.

‘Son,’ said Dr Stevenson, although he’s the same age as Sean, ‘I’ve seen it all in here.’

In the car afterwards, Sean turned to me and put his hand over my tummy. ‘I feel like I’m being disloyal to Amy by saying this,’ he said, ‘but I never realised it would feel like this.’

‘I think we’re going to have to get used to this experience being different from Amy, and try not to feel guilty about it,’ I said. Apparently, I was full of wisdom just then – I, the woman who’d actually forgotten she was pregnant the previous day.

Sean nodded. ‘So what you’re saying is, we mustn’t let feeling guilty ruin this magical thing?’

‘I guess that’s it. And we mustn’t let whatever’s going to happen with Ruby and Lilith spoil it either.’

I immediately regretted reminding him.

‘That might be harder,’ he said, taking his hand off my non-existent baby bump and starting the car. ‘Let’s get the first part over anyway.’

I hated Lilith in that moment. I hated her for ruining what should have been one of the most perfect things that could have happened to me. We should have been driving to tell my mom about the new baby; not to tell the police about Lilith. I hated her.

We picked up Clarissa. She made me get out of the car so she could look me up and down, and hug me.

‘This is just wonderful,’ she said. ‘A baby for Amy.’

Sean and I both smiled. Clarissa knew better than anyone how important it was for us to see this baby in the context of Amy.

‘Yes,’ said Sean. ‘A sister or brother for Amy.’ He paused, and then said something that again shifted my world. ‘For Amy, and maybe for Ruby too.’

Clarissa gave him a long look, her one hand resting on her hip. ‘You know what you’re saying, Sean?’

Sean nodded.

‘This isn’t something you can do lightly. This is different from Amy.’

‘I know,’ said Sean. ‘And we’re really going to try to find Lilith and help her. But I do know that children join families in all sorts of ways, and at least for now, Ruby has joined ours.’

‘Okay,’ said Clarissa. ‘Lucky Ruby to have found you two.’

We all climbed back into the car, and Clarissa directed us to a police station where she knew the station commander from a previous case they’d worked on together.

‘An ugly situation, that one,’ she said as we drove. ‘Nothing as pleasant as this.’ Then she giggled. ‘Insofar as you can call the unexpected disappearance of a grown woman abandoning her child “pleasant”.’

For some reason, all three of us found this very funny, and we had to take some deep breaths sitting in the car before we went into the station, for fear of looking like a group of drunks.

We needn’t have worried – the police station was a sobering place. We stood at the door taking it in.

There were three policemen manning the front desk, each busy with someone. Along the wall to the left of the door ran a bench, with people presumably waiting to be seen. At the far end, closest to the desk, was an elderly white man, his wrinkles almost indistinguishable from the stubble that covered his gaunt cheeks. He wore a knitted beanie, grey from dirt, pulled down over his forehead, and a coat that must have come from a person far larger than him. When he reached into his pocket, and pulled out what looked like a half-jack of whiskey, I saw that he had no teeth.

Beside him, leaning away, was a middle-aged woman with careful hair and make-up, her feet slightly swollen in too-tight pumps, which she kept firmly together. Her hands were clasped around her bag, which she held on her lap as she stared in front of her, as if to a better place.

On the bench beside her, inexplicably, lay a full-grown St Bernard, that appeared to belong to nobody. Even he looked depressed.

A voice from the desk carried over, the private-school accent coming from a well-dressed young man with incongruous dreadlocks, who was trying to give his statement. You could hear his voice becoming more and more strained, but you couldn’t make out the voice of the policeman.

‘He broke the window with a crowbar,’ the man was saying, slowly, allowing the policeman to write down his words. After what seemed like an inordinately long time, he said, ‘You’ve written that he brokened the window with a rock. He *broke* the window with a *crowbar*.’

A pause.

‘No. A crowbar is not the same as a rock. I’m the one who’s going to have to sign that drivel you’re writing. And answer for it in a court one day. Write “crowbar”.’

Everyone in the station seemed to hold their breath.

‘Very well,’ said the policeman, loud enough now that we could all hear him and learn. ‘I will start again.’ He held up the form, which was covered in writing, and slowly tore it in half.

I turned to Clarissa and Sean. ‘This is going to be a nightmare. Do we really have to do this?’

Just then, Clarissa broke away from us. ‘Nombi,’ she called, waving at a black woman whose face was framed by a halo of hair.

The woman glanced our way, and a smile grew across her wide face.

‘Clarissa Grant,’ she boomed in a deep voice. She elbowed a few of her colleagues out of the way as she made her way over to us, pausing only to mutter something at the police officer who’d just torn up the statement.

‘Drama,’ she said as she reached us. ‘These men always want to make a drama when the day is slow.’ She took Clarissa by the shoulders, and looked at her before pulling her into an embrace. ‘Clarissa Grant,’ she looked at Sean and me, ‘tell me you are not bringing me another terrible situation.’

‘It’s not wonderful,’ said Clarissa. ‘But it’s not terrible.’

‘Okay,’ said Nombi. ‘Come.’

She led us into the back, to what must have been her office. A piece of paper was Presticked to her door: ‘Brigadier Nomathemba Silonga’. I made a mental note – just because she was ‘Nombi’ to Clarissa didn’t mean that she was ‘Nombi’ to me. In my limited experience, police could be funny about these things.

Clarissa introduced us and then asked us to tell Nombi our story.

‘Brigadier Silonga,’ I started, ‘thank you for your time, and for allowing us to speak directly to you.’ I looked at her, and I could see that, while she probably would never admit it, I’d made the right call. Then I gave her a short rundown of my relationship with Lilith, what had happened, and where we were now, with Sean interrupting occasionally with a detail.

Nombi picked up a phone and asked someone to bring her a new docket to fill in.

‘So we’ll start with a missing person’s report, and see where it goes,’ said Nombi. ‘Do you have a photo?’

As I scrolled through my cellphone looking for a picture, a nervous-looking young man delivered a pile of blank files, and three pads of paper.

‘Overperforming,’ snapped Nombi.

‘Sorry, Brigadier,’ said the young man, almost whimpering as he backed out of the room.

Nombi looked at us. ‘Enormous potential, that one,’ she said, her smile making her cheeks dimple. ‘Love him like a son.’

I found a photo of Lilith – not a great one, but it would have to do. Nombi looked at it, and then emailed it to herself from my phone. I was a bit taken aback at the way she made herself at home with my device, though I had to admit it was probably more efficient that way.

She opened a file on her desk, and began to complete the form, asking me for details about us and about Lilith. I could answer some of it, but there was a lot of information I simply didn’t know: her car licence plate, who she banked with. I wouldn’t have even known her birthday, but could at least hand over a copy of Ruby’s birth certificate, which had her ID number on it. Nombi got as much information as she could out of me, and gave me a list of the information she still required. Then she turned to Clarissa.

‘I presume that your involvement is more than just getting these good people past the henchmen in the front?’

Clarissa laughed. ‘Indeed,’ she said. ‘That was simply a wonderful bonus.’

‘Best interests of the child?’ said Nombi, using a phrase that was to become the centrepiece of my vocabulary over the next few months.

‘Sean and Rebecca are without any doubt the best place for the child to be at this point, based on the facts I have,’ said Clarissa, suddenly speaking in a more formal voice. I was left in no doubt that she was now in professional mode. ‘I will visit the home this week,’ she continued, ‘and conduct a full assessment vis-à-vis the child.’

‘Conflict of interest?’ said Nombi, who didn’t seem to need full sentences or explanations in Clarissa’s company.

‘Purely professional relationship,’ said Clarissa. ‘The Princes adopted their daughter Amy through me, and have recently been in the process of starting a second adoption.’

‘Nice,’ said Nombi. It seemed that adopting had earned us some extra credit in her book. ‘I will try to prioritise this,’ she said, closing her file and picking up a red pen. She wrote a series of letters and numbers on it that I imagined contained a secret instruction to the effect that we were Clarissa’s VIPs. ‘Unfortunately,’ she continued, ‘people who want to disappear often can disappear. But we can put traces on her bank cards and put checks out for her licence plate. So please let me have all outstanding information as soon as possible.’

I nodded.

‘In the meantime,’ she said, ‘you probably need to talk to a lawyer about the child. Or if you don’t want her, Clarissa can arrange for her to be taken into a place of safety.’

Sean hadn’t spoken much, but he spoke now. ‘There’s no question of that, Brigadier,’ he said. ‘As long as Ruby needs a home, we will be there.’

By the time we got out of the police station, where the same people were still waiting in line, and even the dog had seemed to give us a resentful look for having jumped the queue, I felt exhausted. And there was still more.

‘What was with that dog?’ said Sean, as we all climbed into the car. ‘Do you think it doesn’t have a home?’

I leant my head back against the headrest. ‘Sean,’ I said, ‘you are the kindest and most embracing of men, and I have never been more grateful for that than today. But,’ I closed my eyes for a moment and took a deep breath, ‘you are not bringing home a St Bernard.’

Clarissa laughed from the back seat, but Sean was quiet, and I knew I’d probably been right.

We dropped off Clarissa at her office, and arranged a time for her to come and see Ruby later in the week – ‘Unless it all comes out in the wash, of course,’ she added.

We had an hour before we had to fetch the girls, and the appointment with the lawyer Lerato had found us was only in the afternoon.

‘Can we go by my folks?’ I said to Sean. ‘Can I just, for half an hour, be a woman telling her mother that she is pregnant?’

‘Of course,’ agreed Sean. I waited for him to say something about telling his parents, but he didn’t. ‘And I think we’d better tell her about Ruby too,’ he added.

I nodded. I had to keep remembering that thanks to Lilith, nothing would be the way I’d imagined it. ‘Yes, about Ruby too,’ I said.

On the way to my mom, I phoned Eugenie.

‘Just checking in. Any sign of Lilith?’ I didn’t really think there would be, but for some reason, Eugenie Clarke had become the person who calmed me.

‘No,’ she said. ‘But bloody hell wouldn’t you know in the middle of all this my bloody mother has gone and broken her hip, and I have to bloody fly to Port Elizabeth this evening.’

I was upset. I’d imagined that Eugenie would be the one to help us through this strange transition. I managed to express some sympathy and promised to keep in touch.

‘I’ll pop by the house and say bye to Ruby-Mae, if that’s okay,’ she said.

‘Sure,’ I agreed, buoyed at the thought of seeing her. But we couldn’t find a time when we’d be home that suited her, so I agreed that she could pop in when Gugu was with the girls.

‘I just don’t want her to feel abandoned by anyone else,’ said Eugenie and I was grateful that someone else was as invested in caring for Ruby as Sean and I were.

\*\*\*

That afternoon, we saw the lawyer. When Lerato had given us the name – Marilyn Waxman – I had pictured a small woman. You’d think that my mental image would have been shaped around Marilyn Monroe, if anything, but it wasn’t. For some reason, I thought this lawyer would be small and dark and sharp-featured.

So I was a bit taken aback when a woman of about six foot two greeted us in the reception area of her small firm. She had the shoulders of an Olympic swimmer, and her high cheekbones were topped off with a blunt asymmetrical hairstyle that looked like it might be a wig, a pitch black that could only come from a bottle. She wore half-moon glasses, and had a bright-red mouth, the lipstick slightly overlapping the edges of her lips. To be honest, she looked like she might be transsexual. Her handshake was firm, but her voice was soft and light, an unexpectedly melodic tune from such a vast instrument.

As she ushered us into her office, I felt ambivalent: she didn’t seem like the hero who was going to help us.

By the time we left, I felt like I was a little bit in love.

‘Best interests of the child,’ she said in her little-girl voice once we’d told our story. ‘All that the courts want to know is what is in the best interests of the child. Yes,’ she said, steepling her long fingers, ‘it would be nice for us if this disappearing mother had left some sort of written instruction as to what she wanted to happen. But that’s a luxury. I don’t need it,’ she concluded with a wave of her hand, as if perhaps a lesser lawyer might need such assistance.

‘So what do we do?’ Sean asked.

‘So simple really,’ said Marilyn. ‘We’ll prepare an application to the Department of Social Development, which will be heard by the Children’s Court, to have you declared foster parents in the interim. Nobody’s going to oppose it, so there’ll be no problem, will there? It would be different if there was a father on the scene, but you say not?’

‘As I understand it, he doesn’t even know she exists,’ I said. ‘And I know very little about him. Certainly not enough to trace him, even if we wanted to.’

Even if I had known more, I would have said that. Lilith had been absolutely clear about what sort of man he was, and that he was not someone she wanted to have in Ruby’s life. She’d talked about it at that lunch, all those months ago.

I felt a chill run down my arms. Had Lilith been planning this for so long? Was that why she’d warned me about, what was his name, Ron? Warned me and Rose, both.

‘Something wrong?’ Marilyn looked at me with unexpectedly blue eyes.

‘No,’ I said. ‘Just very clear that the father is not in the picture.’

‘Great,’ she said. ‘The first step will then be that your social worker will place an ad in the newspaper calling on the biological father to come forward.’

I froze. The last thing I wanted was to find Ruby-Mae’s father. But Marilyn saw my reaction.

‘I wouldn’t worry,’ she said. ‘I’ve never actually seen the ad work. It’s a formality, but the reality is that very few people read the smalls. It’s not something you need to worry about. And indeed, it could help you find Lilith. Although again, doubtful.’ She smiled. ‘And after that, the order will be easy, especially with the social worker’s support.’

I started to thank her, but Sean interrupted.

‘And then,’ he said, ‘if we can’t find Lilith, does Ruby stay our foster child forever? Or can we do more?’

‘You could try to adopt her, if you want,’ Marilyn said in a matter-of-fact voice. ‘Slightly harder, bit more expensive, but not impossible. My advice would be that you give it a bit of time before you start that. The mother might still show up. But you can also send her to a place of safety or another foster home. You don’t have to keep her.’

‘But we can?’ said Sean. ‘We can make her our child?’

‘Yes,’ said Marilyn. ‘You can. Although if you don’t mind me saying so, it doesn’t sound like you need a piece of paper. It sounds like, in all the most important ways, she already is. Unless, of course, her mom comes back, which would be the best outcome.’

That’s when I started worrying for Sean. He was so invested in this. Bizarrely so, to be honest.

And I was starting to suspect that he didn’t really want us to find Lilith at all.

# After

In the beginning, the biggest challenge was Ruby herself.

She cried for Lilith every night, and searched for her every morning. I took the studio portraits Lilith had included in the baby book, and had them blown up and framed. I put a photo of Lilith and Ruby on the wall near her bed in Amy’s room, and a different one on the wall with our family photos. I thought about having some of the baby photos framed for the wall, but we still had no idea what had happened to Lilith, and I didn’t want to jump the gun.

The police phoned us every day for the first few days, asking if we’d heard news and, if we pushed them, telling us what they had done, which mostly seemed to be monitoring ATM use and phoning the same hospitals we’d phoned the first day. Lilith’s bank account, which they had located, remained untouched. They’d also looked at her account history. In the last few days before her disappearance, there’d been a payment of the school fees in full, and almost all the cash had been withdrawn.

‘Wherever she is,’ said Nombi, the only time she phoned herself, ‘she’s living off cash for now. We’ll keep monitoring, but it’s unlikely anything more will happen on this side.’

But she wouldn’t tell me how much money had been withdrawn, so I had no idea if I should be looking for Lilith in a hotel or under a bridge.

‘I never got the feeling she had much money,’ said Eugenie in one of our daily phone calls while she was away in Port Elizabeth.

‘Neither did I,’ I said. ‘But I also never got the feeling she’d abandon Ruby. So what the fuck do I know?’

\*\*\*

Rose had phoned me on the Friday ten days after Lilith had failed to appear.

It was strange. On one hand, my life felt completely suspended – like nothing could happen until we found Lilith, and like every moment of every day was devoted to this cause. But on the other, things went on. I looked after the day-to-day needs of the girls, especially Ruby, who was needy and clingy. I looked after the day-to-day needs of my pregnancy, taking supplements and making appointments and planning and dreaming.

But some things were gone. Going to the park was gone – I didn’t think I would ever be able to go back there, especially as it would remind Ruby of Lilith being with us. And my work. My work was beyond me. I was surviving.

‘How’s things?’ Rose said, on the phone. ‘Must be a relief to have Ruby back with Lilith.’

There was a time that Rose might have been the first person I would’ve called after everything happened. And she suddenly seemed to be the one person I wanted to talk to, because she knew Lilith better than anyone else I knew, except Eugenie.

‘Rose,’ I said, ‘you are basically not going to believe what has happened. I’d love to see you and tell you properly. Can you pop by?’

‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Rose without any explanation. But when I started the story, she apparently changed her mind. ‘I’m coming over,’ she said. ‘I’ll reschedule my thing. Oh my God, Rebecca, you should have called me.’

She arrived twenty minutes later with Maggie in tow, and a bag full of ready meals.

‘I didn’t know what would help,’ she said, ‘so I got it into my head that you might not have time to cook. But then I realised that doesn’t even make sense, but by then I’d bought all this, so here it is.’

I laughed, enjoying Rose’s characteristic waterfall of words. ‘I’ve missed you,’ I said.

She gave me a quick hug. ‘Now tell me everything.’

So I did. I told her everything, and she was very sympathetic and asked lots of the right questions. In the moment, I even told her about my pregnancy, which we were trying not to spread too wide ‘just in case’. But it seemed wrong that Eugenie and Clarissa knew and not Rose. I told her about the foster hearing that had been set down to be heard in two weeks’ time, and about how sad Ruby seemed. We discussed what I could do to help Ruby, and Rose gushed about how she’d be happy to help any time.

‘Rose,’ I said, after we’d drunk two cups of tea, and I’d covered the story from just about every angle, ‘do you think there’s a chance that at the beginning Lilith was ...’ I paused. I’d struggled even thinking about this, let alone putting it into words. ‘Do you think she was kind of scoping us out?’

‘What do you mean?’ said Rose.

‘Like the way she used to interview everyone in the park,’ I said. ‘And the way she took us for that lunch and told us all about Ruby’s father.’

‘Yes, I remember all that,’ Rose said slowly. ‘But what do you mean, scoping us out?’

‘I mean, do you think she was choosing someone to abandon Ruby with?’ I finally put what I’d been thinking into words. ‘Do you think that she’d always planned to do this, and was just choosing who it would be?’ It was a relief to say it, and I looked at Rose, anxious for her answer.

‘You think she *chose* you?’ said Rose.

‘Yes.’ I felt glad she’d understood.

‘Over everyone else.’ The curiosity and enthusiasm that had permeated Rose’s whole being up till then was suddenly gone.

I felt wrong-footed, but I wasn’t sure why. I *did* think that Lilith had chosen me, and I was horrified by it. Horrified by how passively I’d been part of someone else’s grand scheme, how cluelessly I’d fulfilled my role. Basically, what I was looking for was someone to tell me I was crazy. And Rose was the only other person who would know.

I started trying to put this into words, but Rose cut me off.

‘I get you’re a famous artist and all that, Rebecca,’ she said, ‘but I don’t think you’re such a great mother that you’re better than anyone else.’

‘That’s not what I’m saying. That’s not what I’m saying at all.’

‘Well, it sounds like you are.’

‘No, I’m just saying ...’ But now I didn’t know any more, because even I could see that in a way I was suggesting that Lilith had thought I was the best choice.

‘Well,’ said Rose, folding her arms, ‘what are you *just saying*?’

‘I’m not saying that I’m the best choice,’ I said. ‘I’m just saying that for some reason I was what Lilith was looking for. Maybe it was the whole adoption thing.’ That felt weak, but Rose seemed to relax. She uncrossed her arms, and her shoulders visibly dropped.

‘I suppose the adoption thing does show that you’re open to taking in waifs and strays,’ she mused.

I wasn’t sure that this was happening. Had Rose really just called my daughter a waif and a stray?

‘What?’ I said.

‘Oh, you know what I mean,’ said Rose, waving her hand. ‘Anyhoo. About time Maggie and I got out from under your feet. It must be so much work with an extra mouth to feed.’

Rose left in a whirl of scarves and Maggie and lost shoes and bags forgotten inside. I breathed a sigh of relief and disbelief when she left, and set about the task of making supper. At least Rose had brought those ready-made meals, I thought. That would do for Sean and I.

But when I looked for the packet that I had put in the freezer, it wasn’t there. I couldn’t find it anywhere. It was a mystery, but not exactly the biggest one I was about to contend with.

---

# Foster

Two things helped normalise the situation. Eugenie came back from visiting her mother in Port Elizabeth, and the foster hearing went off without a hitch.

After the strange end to Rose’s visit, Eugenie’s return was a comfort.

‘My bloody mother,’ she said. ‘Gets me down there on the pretext of a broken hip, and then uses me to make tea while all her friends and their children and their cousins and God-knows-who visit.’

‘Didn’t she really break her hip?’ I asked, shocked.

‘Oh, she broke her hip,’ Eugenie said with a wave of her hand. ‘She’s eighty-three – it’s almost compulsory in her social circle to have broken your hip. But she didn’t need me there. I was a glorified tea girl.’ Then Eugenie started laughing, her shelf of bosom heaving. ‘She kept trying to fix me up with men.’ She laughed so hard that she started wheezing. ‘Young men and old men, gay men and creepy men.’

‘Did you meet anyone?’ I smiled.

‘Jesus,’ laughed Eugenie, almost unable to breathe with the humour of it all. ‘I’m surrounded by sex in that bloody shop all day long. When I get home, I want my cup of tea and my book and maybe some knitting. Not some man.’

\*\*\*

We settled into a good routine, with Eugenie visiting every day or two, and looking after the girls for a few hours. The idea was that it would provide Ruby with a sense of continuity, and would give me a chance to work. We had an extra mouth to feed, as Rose had so awkwardly pointed out, and legal fees to pay. But the reality was that I was still exhausted by my pregnancy, and mostly I just slept in that time. I understood what Lilith had meant when she’d said she could sleep knowing Ruby was with me: I could sleep knowing my girls were safe and happy with Eugenie, just down the passage.

And when I did try to work, something was stuck. I don’t know if it was the pregnancy or the stress of the situation with Ruby or the knowledge that we actually needed the money, but for the first time since I’d started painting the Dogs, my muse upped and left. I tried painting miniatures, and made mistakes. I went back to larger pieces, and couldn’t make the composition work. I even tried some huge pieces, to shock myself out of the lethargy. Nothing.

When I spoke to Joanne, she said I was probably being too harsh on myself. But then she visited and – after spending two hours making papier mâché piggy banks with the girls – looked at the work, and conceded that maybe I needed to rest.

‘Or try something completely different,’ she said, not sounding the least bit worried in the face of my panic. ‘Cats maybe? You used to paint some lovely cats in your roomscapes.’

I agreed that was a good idea, but after that I still just went to nap whenever I contemplated working.

‘Don’t pressurise yourself,’ Joanne reassured on the phone. ‘It’s normal. Most artists have slumps.’

\*\*\*

The foster hearing was a strange experience. I’d expected the whole thing to be like a scene from an American television drama, but instead of the modern court room I’d pictured, Marilyn ushered us into a drab room, and introduced us to a huge woman sitting at a table.

Now that I’d met her once, Marilyn felt like a comforting presence. A kind of enormous mother-figure with an undercurrent of menace. I liked the menace – nobody would mess with us.

‘This is Magistrate Masilo,’ Marilyn introduced Sean and me, and Clarissa, who was also there.

Magistrate Masilo remained seated but held out a hand to shake. Her grip was flaccid and damp; it felt like holding a piece of bacon.

‘Sit,’ she said after the introductions. She looked at Marilyn and patted her braids with one hand. ‘Briefly, Ms Waxman,’ she said.

My heart sank. This woman looked totally disengaged from the tragedy that was playing out in our lives, and she didn’t seem very warm. I reached for Sean’s hand under the table – and found that he was gripping his palms so tightly that his knuckles felt like bones.

Marilyn gave the magistrate an extremely brief rundown of the situation.

Magistrate Masilo squirmed in her hard chair, shifting first to one side and then to the other, as if trying to find a better way to fit her bulk. She blew a stream of air up over her face and leant back in the chair, her arms folded. ‘Ms Grant,’ she said when Marilyn was finished, ‘you have a report?’

‘Yes, Your Worship,’ said Clarissa. ‘I have it here. Should I read it out?’

Marilyn and Clarissa had both told us that this was the usual procedure. Magistrate Masilo, however, had different ideas. She patted her braids again and glanced upwards, as if seeking advice from God.

‘Is there a copy on my file?’ she asked Marilyn.

‘Yes, Your Worship.’

‘And, Ms Grant, do you recommend that this child stay with these people?’

‘Most certainly, Your Worship.’

‘Order granted,’ said Magistrate Masipo, pulling a yellow Bic pen from beneath her papers. She scribbled something on the file cover. ‘Because the mother is completely unaccounted for, I’m going to ask you to come back in six months.’

‘As it pleases Your Worship,’ said Marilyn. I thought it sounded rather rude, but she later told me that was what you say at the end of these things.

Outside the courtroom, Sean and I were ecstatic.

‘That went really well,’ Sean said.

‘Thank you,’ I said to Marilyn. But Marilyn and Clarissa were furious.

‘Six months,’ fumed Marilyn. ‘Overburdening the courts with unnecessarily early returns, that’s what this is.’

‘But it seems fair,’ I ventured. ‘Anything could happen with Lilith.’

‘It’s utterly ridiculous,’ said Clarissa.

‘Exactly,’ said Marilyn.

‘Well,’ said Sean, ‘we’re thrilled. So maybe you two can stop worrying, and let me take us all out to lunch.’

And that’s what we did.

\*\*\*

By this time, it was almost a month since Lilith had disappeared.

On the one hand, Ruby was settling. She was asking for Lilith less, and sleeping through the night. On the other hand, the novelty had worn off for the girls. For Amy, Ruby was no longer an exciting and unexpectedly long-lasting play date, but a rival for my and Sean’s attention. And because we were so aware of what Ruby had lost and the uncertainty that had entered her previously safe and stable world, Sean and I were at great pains to give her a lot of attention.

It was only when Amy had, for the third day in a row, thrown four consecutive tantrums about things that usually didn’t bother her, that we realised she was desperately calling out to us.

Despite my extreme exhaustion, I was waking up at two or three every morning, worry churning through my brain, sending out sparks of adrenaline. I worried a lot about Ruby and about Amy, and about how there could possibly be enough of me to give to the baby I was carrying. But most of all, once the first few weeks had passed, when I lay awake at night, I worried about Lilith. My initial anger had given way to a gut-clenching fear.

‘People don’t just disappear,’ I said to Sean one morning after I’d tossed and turned for hours before, predictably, falling asleep minutes before the alarm clock went off.

‘Not if they don’t want to,’ he said gently. ‘Lilith must have wanted to.’

‘But where is she? Why can’t we find her?’

‘Because she doesn’t want us to.’

‘But she must be wild with worry about Ruby,’ I said.

Sean shrugged. He had little sympathy for Lilith these days; all his concern for her well-being seemed to have been transferred to Ruby.

‘And we don’t know her reasons,’ I carried on.

‘Would you ever leave Amy?’ he asked. ‘Or Ruby? Or this baby?’

No, I thought, I wouldn’t. But that made me worry more, not less.

# Rivalry

I felt strange about the way that I’d left things with Rose, so after the foster order was granted, I called her. I started by apologising for being out of touch, as if the last visit hadn’t ended on a sour note. I explained that we’d been busy with lawyers, but were now more available, and I invited them for a playdate. All else aside, I hoped that the introduction of Maggie might dilute the increasing rivalry between Amy and Ruby. I knew that on one hand it was actually good, a sign that they were seeing each other as siblings. I kept thinking back to my own childhood and the endless fighting and hurting and teasing that was my relationship with Carl. But as much as I could see that this was a natural – even a healthy – progression psychologically, the constant bickering was wearing me down. We needed a break.

When Maggie and Rose arrived, Rose was in top form. She hugged me warmly, then held me at arm’s length and said, ‘You are looking fabulous. Such a strong woman.’

I wondered if I’d actually imagined the end of the last visit; at the very least, I had probably overreacted.

Maggie was eyeing the girls, who at that moment seemed to be the best of friends.

‘Look at that,’ said Rose. ‘Aren’t they the sweetest pair of sisters?’

I smiled, secretly thrilled. But I said, ‘Pair of devils, more like.’

Rose laughed and we all went inside, the girls dragging Maggie off to their bedroom, which we’d recently rearranged to make it more practical for two little lives.

‘This is my box,’ I heard Ruby say.

‘And this is mine,’ said Amy.

And I felt a lightening and gladness that I had overcome my pique with Rose.

Rose and I sat chatting, listening to the girls’ excitement voices that drifted from their room. I caught Rose up on the drama, and she filled me in on some of the park gossip. I hadn’t wanted to go to the park since Lilith had disappeared. I felt a streak of jealousy that Rose’s life had just gone on as normal.

The conversation moved on to Rose’s life, which still seemed mostly consumed with irritation about Aidan’s long hours and frequent travelling.

‘Yes,’ I said, remembering a conversation from what I by then thought of as Life Before Ruby. ‘Lerato mentioned to me that she’d met him through work. I think she’s the lawyer on some deal his company is involved in.’

‘Oh,’ said Rose. ‘That’s strange. They tend to use more senior people.’

I smiled. ‘Lerato is senior,’ I said. ‘She’s one of the best in her field.’ I wasn’t exactly clear on what that field was, but I was very proud of Lerato.

‘I suppose that makes sense,’ said Rose. ‘There’s a lot of pressure for them to beef up their BEE.’

‘I don’t think that’s why they use her,’ I said, wilfully keeping my voice mild. ‘She is very highly respected.’

Rose laughed as if I’d said something funny. ‘Anyway, it’s not like Aidan would make the connection,’ she said. ‘Those kind of details pass over his head.’ And we moved on to talking about things the girls had been doing and whether they were old enough to start horse riding.

We must have been talking about that for about fifteen minutes when Rose suddenly said, ‘Anyway, I don’t know what everyone sees in that Lerato woman.’

‘“That Lerato woman” being Lerato, my best friend?’ I said, laughing.

‘Oh, if you insist on calling her your *best friend*,’ she sneered. ‘Really, isn’t it a bit infantile?’

I tried to think objectively. ‘Maybe,’ I said, more to keep the peace. ‘But she *is* my best friend, so I might as well say it.’

‘Well, I don’t think she’s as pretty as everyone thinks.’

I had no idea how Lerato’s looks had suddenly become an issue. ‘I didn’t really choose her for her looks,’ I said.

‘Not you,’ said Rose.

I was about to ask what the hell she was on about when I remembered what Lerato had said about Aidan preferring black women. I was saved by Maggie letting off a neighbour-rousing yell and running, screaming, to where we were sitting.

She threw herself at Rose so hard that Rose was pushed back into the chair.

‘What is it?’ said Rose.

I reached out and put a hand on her. ‘Are the other girls being naughty to you?’ I asked.

‘They said I can’t be their friend,’ wailed Maggie. Her plump hands covered her face with the melodrama of only a tiny girl.

‘I’m sure they didn’t mean it,’ I said, looking up at Rose to exchange a ‘girls’ look of exasperation.

But Rose’s eyes were flinty.

‘Come, Maggie,’ she said. ‘It’s funny how people who pretend to be all accepting are often the worst.’

‘Rose,’ I objected, ‘they’re little girls. They say things like this all the time. It means nothing.’

‘Maybe,’ said Rose, ‘but instead of playing besties-besties, maybe you should spend more time teaching your *so-called daughters* some manners.’ Her words ricocheted off the walls and into my skin.

I stood up. ‘You know what, Rose,’ I said. ‘This is it. I’m not sure what your issue is, but you always seem to turn on me. I’ll be honest with you – I don’t have the strength to play these games.’

‘That’s just it,’ said Rose. ‘It’s all a game to you.’

That didn’t even make sense, and I spotted Amy and Ruby standing wide-eyed at the sitting-room door.

‘Gugu will open the gate for you,’ I said, grabbing the girls as I walked out.

I played with the girls in their room for a bit, to distract them from what had happened, and to try distract myself. But the conversation kept playing over and over in my head and I couldn’t make it fit properly. Eventually, I called Lerato.

‘You are not going to believe this,’ I started, and related the conversation, as close to word-for-word as I could manage. ‘I mean what the hell does she have against *you*? She barely knows you.’

Lerato was silent. I could hear her breathing, so I knew she was there.

‘Lerato?’ I said. ‘She barely knows you, right?’

‘Well,’ said Lerato, and in that split second I actually knew what was coming. ‘She barely knows me, but I am kind of sleeping with her husband.’

‘You’re sleeping with my friend’s husband?’

‘Kind of.’

‘What the fuck does that mean?’ I said. ‘How do you *kind of* sleep with someone?’

‘Well,’ said Lerato, and I could tell from the evenness of her tone that she knew she was totally in the wrong, ‘I’m seeing someone else as well. So it’s not serious.’

I digested this, thinking how it was still pretty serious for Rose. ‘But anyway,’ I said, ‘Rose presumably doesn’t know about this, so it’s not really an explanation for what happened today.’

Lerato sighed. ‘That’s where you’d be wrong. She knows.’

‘But,’ I said, my objections coming so thick and fast it felt like they were bottle-necking in my throat, ‘that makes no sense. If it’s not serious, Aidan wouldn’t have told her. So how did she find out? And she pretended she didn’t actually know that Aidan knows you. And —’

‘Here’s the thing,’ said Lerato, her tone serious. ‘Those people are crazy, Rebecca. Bat-shit crazy. They have a very sick dynamic in their relationship that I have been dragged into. And that Rose is the weirdest of the two. I could tell you things, but I won’t. But I think you should keep away from her. She is stark raving, Rebecca. Thank God Lilith didn’t leave Ruby with her.’

‘You remembered Ruby’s name,’ I said, suddenly smiling.

I could picture Lerato shrugging. ‘I’m an amoral slag,’ she said, ‘but I’m not heartless.’

‘Hey, that’s my best friend you’re talking about,’ I said softly.

‘Even though I’ve done this?’

‘Always.’ I paused. ‘But next time, maybe warn me.’

‘I’d have to look long and hard to find a situation that’s as fucked up as this one,’ she said with a sad laugh. ‘So I don’t think there’ll be a next time.’

I felt bad for Rose, but when I played back all the terrible things she’d said about Amy and Ruby, I thought maybe Lerato was right. Either way, this time I certainly wasn’t going to be the one to phone Rose. If she didn’t think my girls were good enough for her, so be it.

I just felt dirty that I’d told her so much.

# Lilith

I didn’t have much time to dwell on it.

The call came the next day. I had taken the girls to school, and was engaged in what had become my morning routine of stroking my tummy, drinking tea and thinking about how I should really get to the studio and try to paint.

When my phone rang, all I felt was relief that I could legitimately put off doing any work for a few more minutes. The days of thinking that we’d hear from Lilith at every ring were over.

‘Hello. Could I please speak to Rebecca Prince?’ The woman’s accent was well-educated Johannesburg English: plummy tones that made me think I was perhaps dealing with an upmarket charity drive. I often got calls for painting donations and occasionally gave one, which made the calls multiply. ‘It’s Jean Fischer here from Hospice.’

I sighed. I was right. I’d given a painting to a Hospice charity auction three years ago. As much as I supported their cause, it felt like they’d been hounding me ever since. And with so little work available, I really couldn’t donate this time.

‘I’m sorry —’ I started, but Jean Fischer interrupted me.

‘I’m phoning in connection with Lilith Browne.’

My voice just stopped in my throat, unable to finish the sentence I’d started, unable to formulate a new one.

‘You’ve found Lilith,’ I managed to squeeze out after what seemed like such a long pause that the line might be lost. ‘Where is she?’

‘Oh dear,’ said Jean Fischer. ‘I see this is somewhat of a surprise to you. Lilith left me with the impression that you’d be expecting this call.’

‘Just tell me where she is,’ I said. ‘You have no idea ... We’ve been searching ... The police are looking ... Just tell her that it’s okay, we understand.’

‘I’m afraid I have bad news,’ said Ms Fischer. ‘Lilith died in the early hours of this morning.’

‘What?’ I felt as if the blood in my veins had suddenly become radioactive.

‘She was very brave in the end, and it was peaceful.’

‘What are you talking about?’ I said. ‘Listen, I think there’s been some misunderstanding. Lilith can’t be dead. Just tell her it’s okay. She can come home. We’ll help her.’

‘My dear,’ said Ms Fischer, her tone like that of one who regularly speaks to the deranged, ‘I’m starting to understand that this is a terrible shock to you. Lilith came to us about a month ago, when her oncologist told her she only had a short time left. She said that her child was with you, and that you’d agreed you should only be called when it was over.’ Jean Fischer gave a small cough. ‘I confess, I did wonder that you didn’t even phone.’

‘I didn’t even know she was sick,’ I said.

‘According to the medical history we have, she’s been battling cancer for the last two years. About a year ago she opted to stop conventional treatment. Like I said, about a month ago she was told she had very little time to live. She actually lasted longer than anyone expected.’

‘It was peaceful?’ I managed.

‘Oh, very,’ said Ms Fischer. ‘It’s not always, you know. But she was heavily medicated. She woke up at about eleven last night and had some water. She told the duty sister that Ruby-Mae would be fine, and then she went back to sleep. When we did our rounds, she had died.’

‘Alone,’ I said.

‘Well, yes.’ Ms Fischer sounded defensive. ‘We can’t sit at their bedsides waiting for them to die, you know. We simply don’t have the manpower.’

‘I didn’t mean to criticise,’ I said. ‘I just wish she’d told me. We could have looked after her. Been with her.’

‘At what trauma to the child?’ said Ms Fischer, her voice softer. ‘Lilith explained that she wanted Ruby-Mae to remember her as healthy, not scary.’

‘Honestly,’ I said, ‘being abandoned has been worse.’

Jean Fischer sighed. ‘Yes. The way Lilith explained was different, of course. She implied everyone knew what was happening.’

We were both silent for a bit.

‘Anyway,’ she said, ‘I’ve alerted the undertakers, but you’ll have to take over from here.’

‘What?’

‘A funeral or whatever you wish to do,’ said Ms Fischer. ‘And of course we have her things for you to collect.’

‘Oh God,’ I said.

‘I know this is a lot to take in,’ said Ms Fischer. ‘Perhaps you’d like to come this afternoon after the body has been removed.’

‘I think I need to see her,’ I said. ‘Where are you?’

Jean Fischer gave me an address. Lilith had been within ten kilometres of us the whole time.

\*\*\*

I phoned Sean and told him.

‘She’s *dead*?’ he said.

‘It seems so. I can’t quite grasp this. I need to see for myself. It feels like someone’s playing an elaborate prank on us.’

‘Like maybe she wants us to *think* she’s dead.’ Sean sounded cheered by this idea.

‘That hadn’t really crossed my mind, but I guess it’s a possibility.’

We were both silent, weighing it up.

‘I need you to meet me there,’ I said eventually. ‘I can’t do this alone.’

Sean didn’t hesitate. ‘Okay,’ he said. ‘Give me the address.’

We met at the Hospice, both parking in the treed street outside so that we could walk in together. Jean Fischer was exactly as I imagined her – a woman in her mid-fifties, with perfectly highlighted hair and a kind smile. She shook hands with us warmly, and indicated that we should follow her down a passage.

‘I know this has been an awful shock to you, but it’s something of a relief to me,’ she said as she walked. ‘I just couldn’t grasp how people close enough to take in Lilith’s daughter wouldn’t even have phoned to see how she was doing. I wondered if you could possibly be the right choice of guardian.’

‘We honestly had no idea,’ said Sean. ‘And I’m not sure you can call us “choice of guardian”. Lilith just left Ruby with us and didn’t come back. We have no legal standing, except that we’ve now got the court to declare us foster parents.’

Jean Fischer stopped walking and put her hand to her cheek. ‘Oh dear,’ she said. ‘She really gave the impression that things were formalised.’ She paused, and her carefully made-up eyes searched mine. ‘You are going to keep her, aren’t you?’ Then she clapped her hand to her mouth, making us both jump. ‘Oh, this is terrible,’ she said. ‘I’m speaking as if the child is an abandoned dog or something. I’m sorry.’

I patted her arm. ‘It’s okay,’ I said. ‘We’re also struggling to find the right language for our situation.’

‘Oh, Lilith said you were lovely, and I can see she was right,’ said Jean Fischer. She took a few more steps and then stopped outside a closed door.

I was grappling with the idea that Lilith had been talking about me to this woman, while I’d been struggling to understand that I’d been left with her daughter.

‘Well,’ Jean said, ‘here we are. She’s in here, and we’ve made her look her best. Nothing disturbing. She looks very peaceful. Would you like me to come in with you, or would you prefer to be alone?’

Sean took my hand. ‘Alone is fine,’ he said.

Seeing Lilith’s body had been my idea, but now that I was here, I didn’t want to go in. I’d never seen a dead body before and I wasn’t sure what to expect.

‘Come, Rebecca,’ Sean said. ‘We need to do this. For Ruby.’

I took a deep breath, gave my tummy a stroke, and went in with him.

The body on the bed seemed tiny and I felt a momentary relief – this couldn’t be Lilith, it was too small. But when I got the courage to lift my eyes from the body beneath the blankets to the head on the pillow, I was left with no doubt. It was Lilith; and she was dead.

I swayed against Sean, who helped me over to a chair next to the bed. A chair meant for visitors that Lilith had never had.

‘Why didn’t she tell us?’ I whispered.

Sean was looking at the table next to her bed, and he lifted a photo and showed it to me. It was one of Ruby-Mae laughing, her face half turned towards the camera, the sun catching her halo of blonde hair.

That was when I finally cried.

Sean stood next to me, stroking my back while I sobbed. Every time I thought that I had it together, I would imagine Lilith lying in her narrow bed, looking at the photo, knowing she was dying and thinking about her Ruby-Mae, and I would start crying again.

Jean Fischer came back and pulled up a chair next to me. ‘It’s good to cry,’ she said. ‘It honours the dead.’

I found that so profound that I started all over again, crying for the lack of crying over Lilith’s death. I knew Eugenie would cry too, but other than us, who would mourn the passing of this beautiful woman?

‘Oh God,’ I said, taking Sean’s hand. ‘We have to tell Eugenie.’

‘I’ll phone her now,’ said Sean, rubbing his eyes. He took out his cellphone and went into the passage to make the call.

A few moments later, he was back.

‘She’s coming over as soon as she can get someone to watch the shop. ‘She’s ... broken.’ His voice broke on the word.

The three of us sat in silence.

When Sean was sure that I’d stopped crying, he said, ‘Rebecca, this might seem cold, but maybe there’s a will here somewhere. Or something like that. So we know what she was thinking. She obviously meant for us to understand.’

‘There could be,’ said Jean Fischer. ‘It’s quite unlikely, but you never know. We try to respect the small amount of privacy our residents have left. But, oh dear, she really gave me the impression that she’d given you a will.’ She shook her flawless hairdo. ‘It’s funny, you know, you get a feel for these things. I really thought Lilith was a truthful person and now ...’ Her voice petered out.

‘I think she was a truthful person in a very frightening situation,’ I said. ‘I think she panicked.’

‘I just hope she knew that we’d look after Ruby,’ said Sean.

‘She wouldn’t have left her with us if she didn’t. And she obviously had a better feel for people than I do, because she wasn’t taken in by Rose.’ I felt a wave of anger towards Rose, mixed up with a need to talk to her – a kind of reflex.

‘Do either of you mind if I look around for a will while we wait for Eugenie?’ said Sean.

I shrugged and Ms Fischer said, ‘Go ahead.’

But he found nothing.

Eugenie and the undertakers arrived at the same time, and for some minutes Eugenie and I just held on to each other and sobbed and sobbed, Eugenie’s great chest heaving against me like a distraught beast.

Then Jean Fischer gently moved us out of the room to allow the undertakers to move Lilith’s body, and channelled us into a shabbily furnished office with one of the men from the undertakers. There was a box of tissues on a small wooden table, and two worn couches. The undertaker walked in as if he knew his way around – I suspected this room had a very specific purpose.

‘So,’ said the undertaker, ‘have we any idea what sort of service we would like at this point?’

I obviously hadn’t given the matter any thought, but as soon as the undertaker spoke, I knew we had to give Lilith as proper a send-off as possible. A gathering of the people who actually knew her. I didn’t want Lilith having one of those pathetic funerals with three people standing around awkwardly – I wanted better for her, and I wanted to be able to tell Ruby later that we had honoured her mother.

We said we’d think about things, and get back to them in the next few days.

\*\*\*

Eugenie and I sat down together that evening after the girls had gone to bed.

I hadn’t told Ruby anything because I simply didn’t have the tools. I knew I’d have to do it soon, especially if we intended having this funeral, but I’d decided that it was the work of the next day. In the meantime, Eugenie and I brainstormed every possible person that Lilith knew who would mourn her, and made a list. There were the people at the doctor’s rooms where she worked, the people from the crèche that Ruby had gone to before she changed schools, the neighbours at the flat. We even put Rose on the list, despite my misgivings. And we decided to put an advertisement in the classified section of the newspaper.

‘I don’t think people really look at those any more,’ said Eugenie. ‘Except old people like my mom. She’s always checking to see if her friends are dead.’

‘I know,’ I said, ‘but it’s better than letting her slip away uncelebrated. Someone might see it.’

‘Where did she go to school?’ asked Eugenie suddenly.

‘I have no idea,’ I said. ‘I know she grew up in Durban.’

‘Maybe we could put something on Facebook and ask people to share it,’ suggested Eugenie.

I hadn’t, for some reason, expected Eugenie to be a Facebook sort of person, and it obviously showed in my face. She chuckled. ‘Darling, Facebook is a dream for my type of business. You can do targeted advertising. The web-based side of the business has almost taken over the shop, and most of that’s from Facebook advertising.’

‘I didn’t even know you had a website,’ I said.

‘Discrete, you know,’ said Eugenie. ‘You can buy everything online.’

Sean walked in from reading to the girls. ‘What can I buy online?’

‘Trust me, you don’t want to know,’ I said.

‘Oh, trust *me*, I bet he does,’ said Eugenie, and we both started laughing, hers an asthmatic wheeze.

‘I never realised what a jolly business planning a funeral is,’ said Sean.

We tried to look contrite, but that just set us off again – a much-needed release. While we were trying to recover ourselves, Sean looked at our lists.

‘Newspaper ad?’ he said. ‘Facebook?’ (Which made us laugh again.) ‘Are you sure you don’t just want to contact actual people who knew her and keep it sane?’

‘We don’t know who knew her,’ I explained. ‘Out there somewhere is her childhood best friend and her first love, and who knows who else who will mourn her? We need to try.’

In retrospect, of course, the three of us were very, very stupid.

# Ruby

I told Ruby the next day.

I kept the girls home from school. After the usual routine of breakfast and getting dressed, I tried to send Amy to play by herself so that I could talk to Ruby alone.

‘Amy love,’ I said, ‘Mommy wants to talk to Ruby and you can play with Gugu a bit. That’ll be fun.’

‘No,’ said Amy, ‘it won’t.’

‘No,’ echoed Ruby. ‘I want Amy.’

I didn’t think this was something I should share with Amy, so I tried again. But the girls were adamant: Amy didn’t want to leave us, and Ruby didn’t want to be left. The more I tried, the crosser they both got. I considered putting it off until I could quietly take Ruby aside, and I was tempted – it would grant me a reprieve. But my reprieves were over: I knew that I had to tell Ruby before someone said something in front of her. I would just have to do this with Amy there.

I took both girls into my room and I sat with them on my bed, one small body on each side of me.

‘I’ve got to tell you something sad,’ I said. ‘And it’s hard to understand.’

‘Like green,’ said Amy.

‘What?’

‘Green. Mommy said it’s blue and also lellow.’

I took a deep breath and reminded myself that they were only three, and probably weren’t going to make head or tail of any of this.

‘Remember when Ruby’s mommy was supposed to come and fetch her but she didn’t?’ I said. I felt Ruby stiffen next to me, and I turned so that she had my full attention. ‘Ruby, your mommy got really sick. That’s why she didn’t come back. She died, sweetie. She can’t come back, but she loved you so much.’

‘Where’s Mommy?’ said Ruby. She sounded almost hopeful, as if she absorbed that I now knew what had happened, but nothing more.

‘When people die, we bury their bodies. But the part that makes them the person we love is gone.’

‘Gone where?’

This was difficult. I wasn’t really clear on what message I wanted to give the girls, and I didn’t want to start up a religious path. I didn’t know how to explain to a three year old that she would never see her mother again – it was something I could barely take in myself. If I tried to think about it – about the loss, about the enormity – I started crying. How did I expect Ruby to grasp something so terrible?

I took each of them by the hand, trying desperately to formulate some thoughts on the subject, some words I could give Ruby. I had thought, before I started, that I knew what to say. But faced with the reality of Ruby, the reality of her loss, I realised that my pre-rehearsed phrases were meaningless. I wished that I had got some professional advice on how to handle this.

‘Barbie’s also gone,’ Amy said, interrupting my thoughts and shaking her head sadly – probably in an accurate parody of me.

‘Ja,’ sighed Ruby, ‘Barbie’s also gone.’

It was true that they’d lost a Barbie a few days before. None of us could work out exactly where, but I suspected that she’d been left in a shop, and they’d both been most upset by Barbie’s disappearance.

‘Maybe your mommy be’s with Barbie,’ said Amy.

I knew I should intervene, but this seemed to be working for them. ‘Wherever Barbie and Ruby’s mommy are,’ I said, hoping I wasn’t implying that they were definitely together, ‘wherever they are, they are at peace and they know we will look after Ruby and love her.’

‘Okay,’ said Ruby with a sigh.

‘Do you have anything you want to ask me?’ I braced myself. But I’d forgotten the blessing that is the mercurial mind of a three year old.

Ruby looked at me intently. ‘Can we have sausages?’ she said.

My relief was mixed with sadness that the person who had lost the most couldn’t grasp it. But, I comforted myself, there would be many versions of this discussion over the years. Lilith would be mourned by her daughter – I would not let her be forgotten.

When I told Sean how the conversation had gone, he gave a small laugh. ‘You realise,’ he said, ‘that if they ever find that Barbie, we’re completely fucked?’

I laughed too; I hadn’t thought of that.

\*\*\*

We decided not to take Ruby to the funeral. If there was one thing I’d realised, it was that she was too young to conceptualise what was going on, and it would serve no purpose. But I worried that in years to come, she would blame me that she hadn’t been there.

‘I know that right now you don’t want to know this,’ said Sean, ‘but from Ruby’s point of view, you’ll be the person she thinks of as her mother.’

That was both my greatest hope and my greatest fear.

‘Don’t worry,’ said Sean. ‘You’re doing fine. You can do this.’

The funeral itself was as well attended as I could have hoped. The doctor Lilith worked for and the other receptionist were there, and five of the moms from the previous school. Both Trish and Maureen from our school came, and two mothers who’d met Lilith at drop-off time, and couldn’t believe what had happened. Eugenie was there of course, with three people she introduced as neighbours from the flats, who all shook their heads at the shock of it. Lerato came – ‘Darling, I’m a professional funeral-attender,’ she’d said. ‘In a case like this, I’m happy to be rent-a-crowd.’

My parents came too. My mom remembered Lilith from Amy’s party, and announced valiantly that she would attend for the sake of her new grandchild. I was touched when I finally figured out that she meant Ruby and not the new baby. Sean’s parents didn’t come – they knew nothing of the latest developments in our life – but Susan and her husband came. And Clarissa. Also, the doctor had put up a notice at his rooms, and there were two elderly men, who turned out to be patients.

‘She was always so kind,’ said the one.

‘Always a good word,’ said the other.

Joanne and Trixie also came. ‘Not sure why,’ said Joanne. ‘I didn’t know her. Just thought I should.’

But best for me was a group of four women who, when I went over and introduced myself, said that they’d seen something on Facebook and had gone to school with Lilith. They hadn’t known she was in Joburg, hadn’t seen her for years, but they remembered her fondly. I explained that I was now Ruby’s guardian but knew very little about Lilith’s life, and I took their numbers so we could share memories that I’d later be able to share with Ruby. I wished I’d thought to bring a blank notebook for everybody to write their favourite memory, and made a mental note to ask people to email me.

I wasn’t at all sure whether or not to expect Rose. I’d sent her an SMS and heard nothing. In retrospect, perhaps telling a person about the death of a friend by SMS was in poor taste, but I had been wholly unable to call her after what had happened. To be honest, I didn’t want to see her and hoped she wouldn’t show, but she was also the one person who knew Lilith almost like I knew Lilith. But then when Lerato showed up for the funeral, I realised I had a social minefield on my hands, so when the service was about to start and there was still no sign of Rose, I felt relief.

We hadn’t known what type of service to have, and had simply opted for the prettiest church in the area, where a kindly Anglican priest had spent several hours talking to Eugenie and me about Lilith so that he’d have a good feel for her. Both Eugenie and I agreed to speak at the funeral, and when my turn came, I walked up to the podium at the front of the church and looked over the crowd.

There were three latecomers. One was Rose, dressed in a black dress with a plunging neckline and a wide-brimmed black hat with a veil. She looked like an Italian widow on the cover of a seedy romance novel, and I almost gasped out loud. Next to her was a nondescript young woman who seemed to be taking pictures – but I dismissed the idea as simply ridiculous, because who would take pictures at a funeral? And standing some way from them was a man with his cap pulled down, shadowing his face, and his hands deep in the pockets of a cheap-looking nylon windbreaker. And I didn’t have much time to speculate or absorb anything more.

I spoke about meeting Lilith and Ruby-Mae, and what a remarkable woman Lilith was, and how privileged I felt to be the guardian of her three-year-old daughter. I called on the people gathered to share their memories with me so that I could share them with Ruby when she grew older, and I vowed that I would keep Lilith’s memory alive for the sake of her daughter. I said that I had so much to be grateful for, even in the face of this loss. I said that the people who I knew would be beside Ruby with me on this journey were Sean and Eugenie, and then I invited everyone to join that number, because it takes a village to raise a child, after all.

When I sat down, people reached over to pat my shoulders, and then Sean put his arm around me on one side, and Eugenie gripped my hand on the other. The rest of the service passed in a blur.

When I came out, there was no sign of Rose or the other two mysterious funeral guests. I wondered briefly if I’d imagined them completely, but chided myself that no one could have made up Rose’s outfit. I tried to put them out of my mind, but their unexplained presence lingered like a bad taste.

Many years ago, even before I met Sean, I did a self-defence course. The instructor taught us many tricks and manoeuvres and physical defences. But at the end of each lesson, he told us that the most important thing we could do was trust our own instincts. ‘If it feels wrong, if something feels out of place,’ he said, ‘then don’t question it. Act. Because nine times out of ten, your instinct will be right.’

That day at the church, I forgot. Or maybe it was that I didn’t realise I was under attack.

But I was.

# Ron

He arrived at the door the next morning. The girls were at school, and Sean was at work. I was drinking tea and sketching, pretending to myself and Gugu that at any minute I would go to the studio and work seriously, though neither of us was fooled.

The buzzer rang and I peered into the security camera. It was a man on foot, only the top of his cap visible. I could see a white car in the background. A Citi Golf, I thought, wondering when last I had seen one.

I answered the intercom. ‘Hello?’

‘I’m looking for Rebecca Prince.’ The man’s voice was low, his accent South African but not familiar, his vowels flat.

‘This is she.’

‘I’d prefer to come in.’

‘Could you tell me who you are?’

The man turned and looked straight at the security camera. A nice-looking man, I had to admit, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t a murderer. He looked at the camera for a long moment and I started to feel nervous.

‘How can I help you?’ I eventually said.

‘I’m Ron,’ said the man, turning back to speak into the intercom. ‘Ron Buckley.’

The name meant nothing to me.

‘Yes?’ I said.

He turned back to the camera and smiled so engagingly that I smiled back, even though he couldn’t see me.

Then: ‘I’m Ruby-Mae’s father. We need to talk.’

My first instinct was to slam down the intercom receiver, which is what I did. Ron Buckley didn’t seem to react. He carried on staring at the camera, a smile on his face. But the smile now seemed threatening and it didn’t reach his eyes.

‘No,’ I yelled, and Gugu looked up from her ironing. ‘No, no, NO!’

‘He can’t hear you,’ Gugu said, as if sharing some genuinely helpful information.

‘Gugu, press the panic button,’ I said. ‘No, don’t. Phone Sean. No, don’t.’

Gugu looked at me for a moment, and then picked up the iron again, shaking her head in disapproval.

‘Okay,’ I said to myself, ‘you just need time. You need a plan.’ I took a deep breath and picked up the receiver again. ‘Mr Buckley,’ I said, ‘I’m sure you can understand that this is a bit of a shock. I would prefer it if you would leave me your number, and I’ll let you know when my husband and I can meet you.’

‘You have my daughter,’ he said. ‘This is not something that can wait.’

‘I have Lilith’s daughter,’ I said. ‘I have no proof that you are who you say you are. But we will meet you tomorrow. I’ll let you know a time and a place.’

Again, he looked up at the camera. No smile now, eyes narrowed.

‘Okay,’ he said. ‘Fair enough. But don’t mess me around.’ A flash of a smile. ‘I know where you live.’

I wondered if he was actually trying to make a joke, but then Lilith’s words from that long-ago lunch came back to me: ‘He’s not particularly clever,’ she’d said, explaining why he would never find her.

But he had.

‘Mr Buckley, I have no intention of messing you around. But I will let you know when we can meet, and I would prefer it if you kept away from my home until then.’

Gugu was looking at me with interest again. I wondered if I should indicate to her to push the panic button that would call our armed response company, but Ron Buckley shrugged.

‘Okay,’ he said. ‘You’re just protecting my daughter. Can’t hold that against you.’

‘Okay then,’ I said. ‘Bye.’

‘My number?’

‘Oh yes. Wait.’ I grabbed the nearest piece of paper and pencil – the same ones I’d been sketching with earlier – and took down the number. ‘Okay, I’ll be in touch.’

He waved at the camera. ‘Bye, Rebecca,’ he said. ‘See you tomorrow.’

For the first time in my life, I was shaking so much that I could barely stand. I half stumbled, half collapsed against the wall. Gugu ambled over and helped me to a chair.

‘Is it bad?’ she said.

‘Very.’ Even my voice wobbled. I could feel the tears building. ‘That was Ruby’s father.’

‘Ruby doesn’t have a father,’ said Gugu decisively.

‘Apparently she does.’

But Gugu’s words nudged me: the first thing I’d do would be to ask for a DNA test. Just because a good-looking, stupid man called Ron claimed to be her father, it didn’t mean that he was. But I had a bad feeling: the air of threat had communicated itself through the security camera and intercom, matching Lilith’s description.

The man who caused her crescent-shaped scar.

I hugged myself as Gugu shoved my phone under my nose.

‘One,’ she said. ‘Call Sean. Two. Call a lawyer. Three. Call Eugenie.’

I looked at her, overwhelmed with gratitude. Gugu had a game plan, and it seemed to be a good one.

So that’s what I did. I called Sean. And he called Marilyn Waxman. And Marilyn called Ron Buckley, and arranged that we all meet at her office the next day.

When I left to fetch the girls from school I felt nervous, expecting to see Ron Buckley loitering on street corners. At school, I instructed the teachers that under no circumstances were the girls to be fetched by anyone other than myself or Sean or Eugenie, particularly Ruby, and particularly but not only if that person was a man. That’s how I was speaking – saying things like ‘particularly but not only’.

‘We never let any children go home with unidentified strangers,’ Trish said with an amused smile. ‘You don’t have to worry.’

‘Maybe I should keep them at home,’ I said, completely not reassured. ‘It’s not like they *have* to come to school.’

‘Rebecca, we’ll understand if you do that, but I promise you, I guard every child here as if they were my own,’ said Trish, completely not offended.

‘Right,’ I said. ‘Right. Okay. I’m going to talk to Sean and the lawyer, and see what they think. Right.’

Trish smiled. ‘Right,’ she echoed.

I looked around carefully before I walked out of the school gate, convinced that I’d see Ron or the white Citi Golf I’d glimpsed. But there was nothing suspicious.

Maybe I was overreacting. Maybe Ron just wanted to see if Ruby-Mae was in good hands, and then he’d disappear again.

Maybe.

\*\*\*

Despite the slight lifting of my fear, I didn’t want to leave the girls at home the next day when we went to talk to Marilyn Waxman. I called Eugenie to update her, and when I told her what was happening, she left the shop and came straight over.

‘What do you know about him?’ she asked after she’d given the girls a cuddle and a new set of crayons each.

I told her briefly about the lunch with Rose and Lilith, and what Lilith had said about Ruby’s father. ‘Now that I think about it,’ I said, ‘she was obviously prepping us. In case this happened.’ I laughed without humour. ‘I guess Rose was still in the running back then.’

But Eugenie wasn’t going to be sidetracked.

‘She told me much the same,’ she said. ‘Only in a lot more detail. He’s a dangerous man, Rebecca, incredibly abusive – I couldn’t believe the things she told me, and trust me, I’m not exactly naïve.’

‘I know,’ I said. ‘Sean’s going over to see the lawyer just now, but I’m feeling like I should stay here with the girls. I really don’t want to leave them.’

‘Go,’ she said to me. ‘I’ll stay. It’s important that the lawyer really understands what kind of a person he is. You need to emphasise that.’

I agreed and phoned Sean to let him know that I’d meet him there. As I was about to leave, Eugenie touched my arm.

‘Rebecca,’ she said. ‘I know you have money, but I just want you to know that if you need more to fight this man, I’ll help.’

‘Thank you,’ I said, and my eyes filled with tears. I wasn’t really sure why, except that Eugenie was such an unexpected friend, who had so quickly come to mean so much to me. I don’t know what I would have done without her.

\*\*\*

Sean was waiting for me in the parking at Marilyn’s offices and we went in together, holding hands. I was glad of this when we saw that Ron Buckley had got there before us.

He was sitting back, his hands behind his head, surveying the waiting room. His jeans were worn and he had on the same nylon windbreaker, which I now recognised from the funeral. His cap was now on backwards, so that he looked slightly like an aging rapper, and he was chewing a match. I thought that he would have looked incongruous and uncomfortable in this sleek, professional setting, but instead he looked like a cock among chickens, and the receptionist kept touching her hair, a fresh sheen of lipstick on her lips.

He stood up when we walked in and there was an awkward pause while I waited for him to say something and he, apparently, waited for me to introduce him to Sean. But I couldn’t do it – I couldn’t find the words to act like this man wasn’t threatening everything that we had built up over the last few weeks. I felt like we were stepping into battle, and he was acting like we were at a cocktail party. Eventually, looking at me as if he couldn’t believe I’d let him down so badly, he stepped forward, holding out his hand.

‘Ron Buckley,’ he said. ‘Ruby-Mae’s father.’

I sensed Sean’s hesitation, but there was no way he couldn’t shake Ron’s hand without seeming the lesser man.

‘Sean Prince,’ he said eventually. ‘Ruby’s guardian.’

For a moment they seemed frozen in the manly gesture, bound at the hands, assessing relative strength. Then both men released, each surreptitiously rubbing their right hands with the other, I noticed.

‘Nice offices,’ said Ron, looking around as he unthinkingly flexed his hand. ‘Waste of your money. We could settle this privately.’

‘We would rather have our lawyer in the room,’ said Sean, sounding pompous even to me. ‘To protect Ruby-Mae’s rights.’

‘I’m her father,’ said Ron, adjusting the match in his mouth. ‘Way I understand it, I have rights too.’

‘If you are indeed her father, I’m sure our lawyer can clarify what rights, if any, you have.’

Ron chewed the match thoughtfully. ‘Dates work out. So I’m the father. Lilith wouldn’t have gone with another man.’ He shrugged. ‘You can try fight me into a corner, Mr Prince, but at the end of the day, I know what I know. The kid’s mine.’

The battle had already started.

Sean was saved from responding by the appearance of Marilyn’s secretary calling us through to a small meeting room.

As we trooped through, there was no doubt that Marilyn Waxman intimidated Ron Buckley in a way that we didn’t. He hesitated as he entered the room, and wiped his hands on the windbreaker, straightening it out. He removed the match from his mouth, and touched his cap for a moment, as if wondering about the wisdom of his sartorial choices.

Marilyn lowered her half-moon glasses when he introduced himself, taking her time to take him in, and shook his proffered hand just a moment before he would have had to drop it. He looked out of place and nervous now, like the child in a room full of adults.

Marilyn sat down, and the three of us followed suit.

‘Mr Buckley,’ she began, ‘let me start by explaining that I am here to represent the interests of Mr and Mrs Prince. A social worker and the courts represent the interests of Ruby-Mae Browne. But this meeting is merely so that you can put forward your position and proposals. After that, I will advise my clients on what their rights are. I suggest you retain your own counsel to advise you as to yours.’

‘I’m not paying for some fancy-ass lawyer,’ said Ron, suddenly finding his confidence again. ‘I know what I know. The father has rights.’

Marilyn didn’t even twitch one of her heavy eyebrows. ‘So it is your contention that you are Ruby-Mae Browne’s father?’

‘I’m her father,’ said Ron, reaching to his mouth for the match and finding it missing.

‘Are you listed as such on the birth certificate?’ asked Marilyn, who knew full well that he wasn’t.

Ron shrugged.

‘Do you have any proof at all that you might be her father?’

‘I was living with Lilith at the right time,’ said Ron. ‘Fucking her,’ he added, watching Marilyn for a reaction.

Marilyn didn’t flinch. ‘Were you married?’

‘No,’ said Ron. ‘Living in sin.’ He waggled his eyebrows and grinned, trying to make it sound racy.

‘We call it cohabiting these days,’ Marilyn said with a small smile. ‘I’m sure a psychologist could unpack for you why you see it as sin.’ She didn’t give him time to retort. ‘So, basically, you have no proof of paternity?’

Ron shrugged. ‘You can do one of those DNA tests,’ he said.

‘Everyone’s an expert these days, aren’t they?’ muttered Marilyn.

I was impressed with Marilyn’s approach of simply denying Ron’s paternity, though the truth was I had no doubt that Ron was Ruby’s father. A paternity test wouldn’t help our case – it would just give us some time.

‘Let’s assume for a moment that the test came back positive,’ said Marilyn. ‘What is it you want?’

Ron opened his eyes wide – this was obviously his innocent face. ‘I just want what’s mine,’ he said. ‘I want my kid.’

‘Are you employed, Mr Buckley?’ said Marilyn.

Ron Buckley looked down and fiddled with his cuff. ‘Had a great job,’ he said. ‘Manager. But the boss was out to get me.’ He paused. ‘I’m talking to a few people.’

Marilyn made a note on the paper in front of her. ‘Unemployed,’ she said, as if to herself.

‘And where are you living, Mr Buckley?’ she asked.

‘Here in Joburg, I’m kipping on the floor at my mate Stanky,’ said Ron, a little too quickly. He had enough wit to look slightly embarrassed.

‘And will you be taking Ruby-Mae to live on the floor at Stanky’s?’ Marilyn’s tone was neutral, as if this was a perfectly reasonable proposal.

Next to me, I felt Sean’s back stiffen.

Ron looked confused. ‘Thought she was staying at them,’ he said, with a jerk of the head towards us.

‘But you just said you want her?’ said Marilyn. ‘So I presume she would actually live with you?’

Ron seemed to have an epiphany. ‘They could buy me a place,’ he said, again indicating us with his head. ‘They’ve got the bucks.’

Marilyn put down her pen. ‘Mr Buckley,’ she said, ‘what I don’t think you understand is that the Princes don’t actually have any legal duty to provide for Ruby-Mae. If you take her, as her sole surviving parent you will be the *only* one financially responsible for her. The Princes can walk away. They can walk away right now if they wish.’

Sean flinched, but Ron seemed to have another moment of inspiration. ‘The government gives people money for looking after kids,’ he said, as if that fact settled everything.

‘Yes,’ said Marilyn, for a moment looking so defeated that I bought her charade. ‘You’re quite right. The state will give you three hundred and fifty rand a month. I’m sure that’ll do it.’

‘Well that’s a fucking outrage,’ said Ron. ‘Someone should do something about that.’

‘Yes, it’s shocking,’ said Marilyn mildly. Then she gathered together the papers in front of her, and straightened them with some deliberation. ‘Tell you what, Mr Buckley. Why don’t you go away and think this through a bit. Come back and tell me if you really think living with you is in Ruby-Mae’s best interests. That’s what the court looks at, you know? Her *best* interests.’ She looked slowly from him to us.

Ron’s eyes narrowed. ‘I think you’re fucking with me, lady. My brother knows some lawyers in the clanger. I’m gonna get some advice.’

Marilyn smiled and opened the file again, making another note. ‘You do that,’ she said. ‘You get your lawyer to call me. Oh wait, if they’re in the clanger, they can’t. *You*’d better call me.’ She handed him a card.

He stood up and pocketed it.

It felt like we all breathed a collective sigh of relief as Marilyn indicated to the receptionist to show him out. Then she closed the door to the meeting room and leant against it.

‘Nasty piece of work,’ she said.

I jumped up. ‘But you were fabulous,’ I said.

Sean was standing too, holding out his hand. ‘How can we ever thank you?’ he said.

Marilyn ignored Sean’s hand. ‘Please, sit down again,’ she said. ‘That went well only insomuch as I played the power dynamics quite well. I’m rather good at it, and when it comes to men like him, I get some pleasure.’ She gave a shrug. ‘But the reality is that the legal picture is not actually in your favour.’

‘But,’ I interjected, ‘you said it yourself – the court will look at Ruby’s best interests. Us, or an unemployed wife abuser. That’s assuming he can even show he’s the father.’

‘First,’ said Marilyn, ‘if he can show that he was living with Lilith at the relevant time, there is actually a legal presumption that he *is* the father. It would be for us to show that he’s *not* the father.’ She looked at me. ‘Any chance of that, do you think?’

I said nothing and looked at my hands.

‘Thought not,’ said Marilyn. ‘Although we’ll make him jump through hoops on that one. Once he’s the father, though, the court then assumes that it’s in Ruby’s best interests to have some sort of relationship with him. At the very least.’

‘But that’s bullshit!’ exclaimed Sean. ‘He’s never even tried to find her before this. He’s not interested in her.’

Marilyn squeezed the bridge of her nose. ‘If he’s not interested in her,’ she said, ‘then what is he doing here?’

The question hung in the air.

‘Okay,’ said Marilyn, ‘the game plan from here is that we wait to hear from him, and then we take it one day at a time. If he contacts you directly, have him call me. If he arrives at your door, send him away. If he starts hassling you, we’ll get a protection order. We keep him away from Ruby unless a court tells us otherwise. One step at a time.’

# Post

Sean was sure we were done with Ron Buckley.

‘That guy was just looking to make trouble,’ he said. ‘He hadn’t thought it through. When he realised he might end up with a three year old to support, he bolted.’

I nodded, and said I was sure that he was right. But I wasn’t. Ron Buckley was a stupid, abusive and arrogant man, and I didn’t think we’d heard the last from him. I hoped that Sean was right though, and I tried to quell my fears.

And there were other things going on. Overnight, I’d gone from being an infertile mother of one to a pregnant mother of two. I’d been getting by on adrenaline, but as the days passed, and we heard nothing more from Ron Buckley, my new life began to take its toll. Parenting was that much harder these days: Ruby was a bereaved and confused little girl, and, without any forewarning, Amy had been forced into being a sibling, and sharing me and Sean. Both girls were acting up, so on Clarissa’s advice I took them both to play therapy – an expense we could ill afford these days. Without me painting, Sean’s business wasn’t quite overcoming the hump that meant we were financially safe. The good news was that the play therapist assured me that Amy and Ruby were just normal little girls adjusting as well as they could to an abnormal situation. But it was still tough on them.

It was a Thursday when we decided to tell them about the baby. Sean came home early, and we made home-made pizzas together. When the girls were relaxed and drinking their chocolate milks, Sean started.

‘So, girls,’ he said, ‘you know that we are so excited because we’ve grown as a family and now Ruby is part of it?’

Ruby nodded and Amy blew bubbles in her milk.

‘Well, Mommy and I want to tell you another exciting piece of news.’

‘Mommy’s dead,’ said Ruby.

‘No, she’s not,’ said Amy.

‘Rubes,’ said Sean, ‘when I say “Mommy”, I mean Rebecca. I know your special mommy is dead and we are so sad because we miss her. But we need a name for Rebecca that we can all share.’

Ruby and Amy looked at him blankly, and I sighed. Sean sounded like he’d swallowed a pop psychology book, and it was true that the pile of parenting manuals on both of our bedsides would have put a small bookshop to shame.

‘So anyhow,’ I took over, ‘the exciting news is that I have a baby growing in my tummy, and in about six months the baby is going to be born, and we’ll have a new brother or sister in the house.’

Sean looked pissed off that I had stolen his thunder, but Amy’s eyes were wide.

‘A sister or brother. For Amy,’ she said.

I smiled. ‘Yes. And for Ruby.’

‘No,’ said Amy, ‘only for me. Ruby’s not a sister and this baby’s not for Ruby.’

‘Amy,’ I said, ‘families get made in different ways. Ruby is now a sister, and the baby will be a sister or a brother to both of you.’

Amy looked at me with those heartbreaking, big brown eyes, and for a moment our souls connected in that way I often felt could only happen with her – my first child, and for so long, my only child.

‘Mommy,’ she said in a soft voice, ‘let’s just get a puppy.’ She climbed onto my lap and put a thumb in her mouth, a habit she’d long ago stopped. ‘Sometimes,’ she said, stroking my hair with her free hand, ‘I want to be just me and Mommy.’

I wanted to say, ‘Me too,’ but I couldn’t, because Ruby’s clear-blue eyes seemed to be examining my thoughts.

Sean stepped in. ‘Looks like Amy needs some special Mommy time, am I right?’ he said. Amy nodded, her head against my chest. ‘And I bet Ruby could use a cuddle from me,’ he said, picking up Ruby. ‘And then how about a walk?’

Ruby nodded and after a few moments Sean lifted her down and made a move to start their walk.

‘Could you stop at number 109 and see if those Blundys have anything of ours?’ I said over Amy’s head. ‘I haven’t been for a while and she never delivers our post here.’

‘Sure,’ said Sean. ‘Come on, Ruby-Tuesday.’

‘It’s Ruby Ruby,’ said Ruby, taking his hand.

I blew her a kiss. ‘Have a good walk, guys.’

It felt like a treat, I admit, having a small window of time with just Amy. I knew I needed to make this happen more often, and that I had to do it for Ruby too, and for the baby when it came. I sighed as I buried my face in Amy’s hair. Everything had become so complicated since those days in the park. I wrapped my arms around Amy as I watched Sean and Ruby walk out the gate, hand in hand, Ruby’s head moving as she chatted away. I felt a taste of the resentment that Amy must have felt when she saw us with Ruby, but I also felt a wave of love for that small blonde shape – more intense than I had ever felt for her before. I thought that I would talk to Sean about all these mixed feelings when he got back; see if he felt similarly torn.

\*\*\*

But when Sean came back from the walk, he was livid.

‘That Mrs Blundy,’ he said, throwing down a pile of post on the table, ‘is a world-class, absolute selfish bitch. Excuse me, girls – please don’t repeat anything Daddy says.’

I nodded. ‘Holding on to our post again?’

‘Fuck the post,’ said Sean. ‘Oh, er, Amy and Ruby, I think I can hear your dollies calling you.’ The girls smiled at Sean and ran off. ‘That’s my girls,’ he called after them.

I was impressed – that approach never worked when I tried it.

‘Rebecca, that woman. That woman is so bad she’s like ...’ He waved his arms in the air as if hoping to summon a strong enough comparison. ‘She’s like my *mother*,’ he eventually said.

‘Oh, darling,’ I said, without stopping to think. ‘Nobody’s that bad.’

Sean looked stunned for a moment. ‘Actually,’ he said in a less hysterical voice, ‘Mrs Blundy is.’

‘What happened?’ I picked up the post.

‘She looked at me and she looked at Ruby and then she said she was so glad we’d stopped our charity nonsense and decided to look after our own child.’

The post felt heavy in my hands.

‘Then,’ said Sean, ‘when I asked her what she was talking about, she said she didn’t hold with this business of bringing darkies into the suburbs.’

I was speechless, heavy with the knowledge that this sort of comparison would become even more part of our lives now than it had before. In our eyes, Amy would always be our firstborn, but in the eyes of the world, she would be the odd one out. Especially when the baby came. I ran my hand through my hair.

‘I think I’m going to lay a charge,’ said Sean.

I laughed. ‘Of what? Rudeness? Racism? If the police had to investigate every incident of racism, the whole system would fall apart.’

‘You just can’t go around saying things like that,’ said Sean. ‘There must be something we can do.’

I started sorting the post again, putting bills on one side and junk mail on the other.

‘We could get Lerato or Marilyn to write a letter telling her that if it happens in front of the kids again, we’ll lay a charge. And that we’ll regard as theft her keeping any post for more than a week. Yes, that’s it ...’ Sean continued.

But I wasn’t listening. I was looking at the bulging envelope in my hand. Cold tendrils reached up my neck.

‘Sean,’ I said, but my voice came out as a squeak, and he carried on. ‘Sean,’ I said more loudly.

‘What?’

‘This is Lilith’s handwriting,’ I said. ‘This is from Lilith. I recognise her handwriting.’

He took the envelope. ‘This was sent three months ago,’ he said. ‘When this all started.’

We looked at each other.

‘Open it,’ he said eventually.

The first thing I removed from the envelope was a list in Lilith’s handwriting. It was written on plain lined paper, and looked like it’d been torn from a notebook. In lines written with different pens it said:

> \[digi note: handwriting typeface needed for this list. circle “Rebecca” – she has made her choice; and above, “gut feel” to be underlined\]
>
> Good mothers take their children to the park.
>
> Good mothers are friendly and make good friends.

>
> Good mothers don’t gossip.
>
> Options
>
> Gut feel
>
> Schooling
>
> Money
>
> Rebecca

\[end\]

I held out the paper to Sean.

‘This is how she chose,’ I said. ‘I knew it. I knew there was some sort of process she must have followed.’

Sean looked at it. ‘I don’t know if this is what I would call a process, Rebecca,’ he said. ‘It seems a bit arbitrary.’

‘It’s her way of telling me how she chose me. And she’s giving me a touchstone for parenting Ruby.’

Sean raised his eyebrows. ‘If you say so,’ he said, opening a folded wad of typed papers. ‘Oh my God, yes! It’s a will.’ He scanned through it. ‘There’s a savings account being held for Ruby,’ he muttered. He looked at me and then read: ‘*I appoint Rebecca Prince as Ruby-Mae Browne’s legal guardian until such time as she reaches majority. I appoint Sean Prince as the executor of my estate. Should Rebecca Prince die prior to Ruby-Mae Prince attaining majority, I appoint Sean Prince as her legal guardian.*’

I was about to interrupt but he held up his hand, and carried on reading.

‘*I wish to make it clear that under no circumstances should Ruby-Mae’s natural father be sought or allowed to have any rights in relation to her*. This is it. This is what we’ve been waiting for.’

‘Isn’t it a bit weird that she didn’t even entertain the idea that we might refuse?’ I asked, thinking aloud. ‘Shouldn’t she have made a back-up plan, like we have?’ In our will we’d made Sean’s sister guardian, and failing her, my brother Carl. I made a mental note that we’d have to update our will now that we had all these children, and make it clear that Ruby counted as our child.

‘Why would she need a back-up plan?’ said Sean. ‘She knew we wouldn’t say no.’ He waved the papers at me again. ‘I’m phoning Marilyn. Even if Ron comes back, it’s a slam dunk.’

But when Sean got off the phone, he was less excited.

‘She says it helps,’ he said, ‘but that Ron Buckley still has rights if he chooses to fight for them.’

‘Well,’ I said, ‘so far he’s been quiet, so let’s just hold thumbs that he’s changed his mind.’

‘I wish we could get something from him renouncing his rights,’ said Sean. ‘So that we don’t have to live with the worry.’

‘Maybe we can ask Marilyn about that. But not right now,’ I added as Sean reached for his phone. ‘It’s not urgent.’

But the next day’s call to Marilyn was urgent.

# The key

We’d run out of milk and bread so I took the girls for a walk to the local shop. It was probably stupid of me, but I’d felt my exhaustion lifting, and I wanted to make the most of the sunny afternoon. It was slightly further away than really suited the girls’ short legs though, and Amy began complaining bitterly when we were about a hundred metres from the shop. Ruby followed suit and collapsed theatrically on the ground. I had to half drag them the rest of the way, muttering part encouragement and part mild obscenities. At the entrance to the shop, unsure of how I was going to manoeuvre two reluctant toddlers to the milk and bread sections, I even considered turning back.

‘If you behave,’ I said, ‘I’ll buy you each a chocolate to eat on the way home.’

I looked up and noticed one of the tellers staring at me. She whispered something to the customer with her, who turned to stare at us too. Honestly, I thought, have they never seen a mother bribing her children before?

Now on best behaviour for their promised chocolates, the girls walked hand in hand with me towards the bakery section at the back. Behind us, one of the tellers made a loud comment in Zulu, which I couldn’t understand, but suddenly I noticed that a number of people were looking at us. I couldn’t understand it, so I lifted my chin and walked on.

We got the bread and the milk, and then the girls spent some time choosing which chocolate they wanted. Usually I would have got impatient, but that day I was happy to give the tellers a bit of time to get over the terrible trauma of witnessing my parenting skills. I shook my head, trying to dislodge the paranoia.

Eventually the girls each chose chocolate: Amy a green Aero and Ruby, inexplicably, a small Chomp. I pointed out that she could have a full-sized chomp, but she was adamant. When we got to the queue at the tellers, it felt like all their heads jerked towards us, and I told myself to get a grip.

We were standing behind a woman who was so thin that her clothes hung on her. Her hair was lank, and she smelt slightly. I glanced at her shopping, and saw it was mostly chocolates, wine and cigarettes, and in her hand she held the latest issue of *About!*, the weekly tabloid magazine you find in every doctor’s waiting room across the country. I don’t ever buy it but I do have a secret fascination, so I glanced at the cover.

At first glance, I thought it was a picture of some celebrity with her two children, each holding a hand. The photo was blurred, like the subjects hadn’t known it was being taken. The one child was white and the other black, so I looked a bit closer, shuffling nearer to do so.

The woman wasn’t Angelina Jolie, although for a moment, I thought that she looked vaguely familiar.

And then I realised: she was me. And the children were Ruby and Amy.

I left my place in the queue, telling the girls to stay and watch the basket, and grabbed my own copy of the magazine off the rack. As well as the full-cover picture of me looking furtive with the girls was an insert photo of Ron Buckley. *Father’s heartbreak*, said the headline across the bottom of the cover. *I didn’t even know I had her and now strangers won’t share her*, it said underneath. Ron had been photographed in such a way that he looked both devastatingly handsome and absolutely miserable. I paid for the shopping and the magazine as if I was hypnotised.

‘This is you,’ said the teller, stabbing at the cover of the magazine.

‘Yes,’ I agreed, my voice coming from far away.

The teller looked again and then pointed at Amy. ‘You must give her back,’ she said.

‘No, it’s ...’ I started to explain. But there was no point. ‘Mind your own fucking business.’

The teller was silent as we finished the transaction, and I wondered if I’d ever be able to walk into this shop again.

I almost ran us home, holding hands with the girls, who were each also holding their melting chocolates. The plastic bag with the bread, milk and magazine hung cutting into my wrist as I half-dragged my children over loose gravel and stones, miraculously keeping them upright, desperate to get them behind the safety of our high wall.

As soon as I in the front door, I read the article: a four-page feature filled with photographs of me, my children and Ron. There was the photograph of Lilith that I’d used on the funeral pamphlet and there was even a photograph of Eugenie with the title, *Sex Industry Madam plays questionable role*. The gist of the article was that poor Ron had been tricked by his unfeeling ex-girlfriend and hadn’t even known that he was a father. And now, in the wake of the girlfriend’s death ‘under mysterious circumstances’, two ‘strangers’ wouldn’t even let him meet his ‘long-lost daughter’. The article went on: *World-renowned artist Rebecca Williams and husband Sean Prince have the money and power to fight for little Ruby-Mae, while destitute father Ron Buckley is unable to pay his rent, let alone the expensive legal fees that would be necessary to assert his rights*. And it ended with the kicker: details of a bank account into which readers could deposit money to ‘Help Ron Fight for his Baby’.

I read the article twice, unable to believe what I was seeing. What scared me was the level of detail about the situation, things Ron certainly wouldn’t have known, like where Lilith had worked and where Ruby-Mae went to crèche before she had changed schools. It had some details about what had happened after Lilith left Ruby-Mae with us – that we had gone to the police and eventually discovered her death – but written carefully, so that none of it expressed our worry and heartbreak. Somehow, it just made us seem careless, the sort of people who lose friends. The very worst was that they knew about my pregnancy, and managed to write about it in such a way that it sounded like I had faked my infertility for some unmentioned nefarious purpose. I had told so few people about the pregnancy, I just couldn’t understand how the writer of the article knew about it. The article simply said, ‘According to sources close to the Princes’. I shivered.

I phoned Sean when I was finished reading.

‘I just saw it,’ he said as he answered. ‘Adam’s wife bought a copy and he brought it in.’

‘What do we do?’ I asked. ‘How is this happening?’

‘I don’t know,’ said Sean. ‘But I’m making an appointment with Marilyn right now.’

Sean rang off and I went back to examining the article. The thing that confused me the most – besides the mention of my pregnancy – was the photographs. The cover photo had been snapped without me realising, and the background was removed so I had no idea where it was. But there were more photographs in the article – one of me laughing, with the caption, *Rebecca Williams refuses access*, and another of Ruby-Mae looking bereft, with the caption, *Will she ever meet her dad?* In both those photographs there was a bit of background, which seemed to be mostly grass. In the picture of Ruby, there was something red and plasticky looking in one corner.

Suddenly, the penny dropped: these pictures had been taken in the park.

There was also a photograph of the funeral with the casket at the front of the church. The caption read, *Little Ruby-Mae was not allowed to attend her own mother’s funeral*.

I cast my mind back and remembered the people I’d seen as I stood at the pulpit. Rose, looking like the widow of a mafia Godfather. The man who I now realised was Ron Buckley. And the mousey young woman I’d suspected of taking photos.

And who’d been standing next to Rose.

I turned back to the photographs of me and Ruby taken at the park. The photographs that must have been taken by one of the three of us; one of my park friends. Lilith was dead, and I hadn’t taken those photographs, so that left Rose. Rose, who was always snapping ‘action’ pictures of all of us in the park.

Rose, whose pictures used to make me laugh.

Rose. Rose and Ron Buckley. I felt sick.

My phone rang – Sean. ‘I called Marilyn,’ he said. ‘She was about to call us. She’s had an urgent application for access served on her offices and she says we need to come in and see her. He’s not asking for custody yet, but he wants access.’ Sean paused. ‘Rebecca,’ he said, ‘she says he’ll probably get it.’

‘But we have the will now,’ I said. ‘Surely that counts for something?’

‘It’s all about Ruby’s best interests,’ said Sean. ‘And apparently having a relationship with an abusive, unemployed man she has never met will be in her best interests.’

\*\*\*

And that’s what Marilyn also told us that afternoon. The hearing was set down for the next Tuesday and, barring a miracle, Ron would be granted some sort of access.

‘We’ll try to fight it,’ said Marilyn. ‘And in the alternative we’ll push for supervised access with Clarissa, in your home.’

‘In our home,’ I repeated. The idea of Ron poisoning my space made me feel sick. ‘What about Amy?’

‘One of you would take her out for that time.’

Then we asked her about the magazine article.

‘There are several ways you can handle it,’ she said. ‘You can make a big fuss and threaten to sue and even try to sue. It’ll go nowhere – defamation is a tough case to prove in this country, and I don’t think there is anything in this article that is factually untrue. *About!* has very clever lawyers in that respect. We could, however, take issue with the fact that you weren’t given a chance to comment, and ask for your side to be expressed.’

‘And have another tacky article about us?’

Marilyn nodded. ‘Exactly the problem.’ She pushed her glasses up her nose. ‘I think the best thing we can do with this is use it for our case. We’ll refer to it in the court papers as illustration of the type of person Buckley is, and his unsuitability. We’ll make the case that no one putting his child’s interests first would have done this.’

Sean rubbed his neck. ‘He’ll say he had to get the money to fight us.’

‘Yes,’ said Marilyn, ‘he probably will.’

‘So in summary,’ I said, ‘anyone can publish anything about us, and Ron Buckley has rights that we can’t fight.’

‘You can fight,’ said Marilyn, her singsong voice gentle given how aggressively I’d spoken. ‘You can make it hard for him, you can make it expensive for him, and you can stop him from getting full custody.’

She took her glasses off and put them next to the file.

‘Most of these cases are not won in the court,’ she said. ‘Ron Buckley doesn’t really want Ruby-Mae and all the related expenses. He wants something else. He might like the attention. He might think there’s money in it. The real trick here is to figure out what’s feeding this, and find a way to either give it to him, or to stop him from getting the attention he wants. In the meantime, I think we should also start adoption proceedings.’ She smiled weakly. ‘And if we can find the key to this case, you use it to get him to sign the papers and give up his rights.’

‘You seem to be telling us to threaten him?’ said Sean.

Marilyn put her glasses back on. ‘I wouldn’t be a very good lawyer if I was telling you to do that,’ she said, pretending to be fascinated by something in her papers.

\*\*\*

It played out much as Marilyn had said it would.

We filed affidavits and set out a case for why Ron wasn’t a suitable influence for Ruby-Mae. When I read through our case, I was sure we would win – it was so obvious. But Ron now had a smart attorney – paid for no doubt with the money he’d milked out of gullible *About!* readers who believed they were doing good.

And when it came to court, Ron was wearing an expensive dark-grey suit with a light-blue shirt that brought out the colour of his eyes. He’d had a haircut and the match had gone from between his lips. He must have been carefully coached, because even his characteristic slouch had gone, and when his case was presented, his eyes filled with tears, which he somehow managed to draw attention to while at the same time looking like he was manfully holding them back.

When Marilyn presented our case, the magistrate was scathing. The evidence of abuse that Eugenie and I had sworn to on affidavit was dismissed as hearsay.

‘In any event, Ms Waxman,’ said the magistrate, ‘you know full well that even if he beat the mother black and blue, that doesn’t mean he’ll hurt the child.’

He was a man this time. When we’d first seen him, I was glad – at least Ron’s striking looks wouldn’t play a part. But the down side was that he seemed very supportive of the rights of fathers, and I wondered if this might be personal.

In the end though, he obviously did give the evidence of abuse some weight – or so Marilyn told us – because he ordered that Ron could spend two afternoons a week visiting Ruby-Mae at our house or at Clarissa’s rooms, and that Clarissa would supervise all visits. The cost of Clarissa’s supervision would be paid half by Ron and half by us. Marilyn questioned this, but the magistrate raised his unruly eyebrows and said, ‘Would you prefer unsupervised, Ms Waxman?’ And we were all to return to court after three months, when Clarissa would submit her report.

We felt defeated when we left the court.

‘It’s as good as we could have expected,’ said Marilyn. ‘Three months, twice a week, is a big commitment. My guess is that Ron’s going to get bored of it.’

‘What if the opposite happens?’ said Sean. ‘What if he falls in love with Ruby like I ... like we have?’

Marilyn looked at him. ‘Sean, if that happens, would it really be so bad for Ruby-Mae to have her biological father in her life?’

‘An abusive man who abandoned her mother?’

‘Her mother left him with no forwarding address. He didn’t even know she was pregnant.’ Marilyn looked from one of us to the other. ‘I know this isn’t what you want to hear, especially from me. But I’m trying to show you the objective facts here. Buckley is a creepy man, but if you allow yourself to, you can see his side.’

At home, Sean and I talked about changing lawyers.

‘She’s not on our side,’ said Sean, and it certainly felt that way. But when we talked to Lerato, she pointed out that Marilyn’s job was to tell us the legal truth.

‘You might not like it,’ she said. ‘Hell, Marilyn might not like it. But a good lawyer gives you the full picture.’

# Home visit

The idea of letting Ron Buckley into our home appalled me. But I also agreed that it would be easier for Ruby if she was in a familiar environment. Reluctantly, I agreed with Clarissa that she could set up a time with Ron to visit Ruby at our house.

‘Just watch him the whole time,’ I said to Clarissa. ‘If you need to go to the toilet, you take Ruby with you.’

‘It’s an hour, Rebecca,’ she said. ‘I think my bladder will last. Stop worrying – this is part of my job. Ruby will be fine.’

I told Ruby that a very old friend of her mom’s wanted to meet her, and that he would come to visit with Clarissa. She seemed excited, and told me that she like Clarissa. I wanted to shake Ruby, to yell that she was in danger. Instead, I pulled her little body towards me and held her.

‘You’ll have fun,’ I said. ‘You just remember that Rebecca and Sean love you so much, okay?’

‘Okay,’ she said. ‘Ruby loves Becca too.’ Then she turned to go back to the blocks she’d been playing with. Even though we had, in my eyes at least, lost in court, and had to allow Ron Buckley into our home, at that moment I felt like a winner.

That first afternoon I took Amy out, and left Clarissa and Gugu to meet Ron. Ruby was excited to have Clarissa as her special visitor, and Amy was excited to have special time with me. I was the only one who didn’t think this was the most fabulous day since Christmas.

Amy and I went and had what Amy called a ‘lady date’: decaff cappuccino for me (because of the baby) and a babyccino for Amy. Amy’s favourite thing to do with the cup of frothy milk was to line up a paper sachet each of brown sugar, white sugar and sweetener. She’d then carefully tear the top off each one, lying them down again. When all three were open, the sugars were added one by one to the babyccino and stirred in, a look of great concentration on Amy’s face. Then she’d pick up the small cup, take a sip, and give a sigh of contentment – a mirror image of Sean having his first sip of coffee of the morning.

Usually when this happened, I got frustrated. I’d say things like, ‘Too much sugar, Ames,’ and, ‘Don’t mess now,’ but that day I just sipped my coffee and watched her, enjoying the absorption of a small child.

‘Good?’ I asked, after the first sip.

Amy sighed, and leant forward. ‘A bit sweet,’ she confided.

I laughed out loud, and she beamed with pleasure. We ordered cake and afterwards we walked around the shops, and talked about what we hoped Father Christmas would bring us.

‘He’s bringing you a baby,’ she said, pointing at my tummy.

‘Well,’ I said, ‘the baby won’t be here till after Christmas. And the baby is a present for all of us. Daddy, Mommy, Amy, Ruby.’

Amy frowned. ‘Is Ruby ours forever?’ she said.

‘I hope so,’ I answered.

Amy thought for a bit. ‘Me too,’ she eventually agreed.

\*\*\*

I made sure we got home after Ron had left.

‘How did it go?’ I asked Clarissa, sinking down onto a couch. Amy and Ruby had thrown themselves at each other as if they hadn’t seen each other for a week.

‘Rebecca, I need to be neutral in this, so I’m going to be careful what I say,’ she started.

I felt my eyes fill up with tears. It felt like everyone who was supposed to see our side of the story were carefully trying to see Ron’s.

‘What I can tell you,’ she said, ‘is that he has absolutely no idea what to do with a three-year-old girl.’ She winked, and moved a cushion so that she could sit next to me. ‘It was kind of funny.’

I sighed. ‘Anything else you can tell me?’

Clarissa breathed out and lent her head against the back of the couch. ‘The thing that surprised me,’ she said, ‘was that he seemed interested in art. He looked around at your pictures, and he knew about your dogs.’

‘He’s researched me,’ I said.

‘But he knew quite a lot,’ she said. ‘He was very taken with your print of the Picasso.’

‘Actually,’ I laughed, ‘it’s an original etching. Although that sounds so grand. It’s not really worth all that much.’

But I loved that Picasso. Sean had given it to me on our first wedding anniversary – a paper gift in line with tradition, an in-joke about the fact that the grand master had also drawn his dog, and a reference to the first time Sean and I had met. I wasn’t lying – a Picasso etching is not like a Picasso painting, and is actually moderately affordable. Ironically, you could buy a Picasso etching for cheaper than you could buy an original of my Dogs. But still, when Sean had bought it, it had stretched the budget. I loved him for his thoughtfulness and the largesse of the gesture, and of course it was fun to refer to ‘the Picasso’. It’s one of those items that I’d never sell, not for anything, and I told Clarissa the story.

‘So,’ I said, ‘he’s abusive, stupid and awful, but at least he has good taste.’

Clarissa rubbed her forehead. ‘I’ll be sure to mention that in my report,’ she deadpanned, and we laughed more than was warranted, a release after what had been a hard afternoon. ‘I’d like to observe them at my rooms next,’ she said after a few moments, professional again as she stood up. ‘Force them into a more one-on-one situation. Could you bring Ruby to me at 3pm on Thursday? After that we can alternate venues.’

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Just promise you’ll watch him.’

‘Rebecca,’ she reminded me, ‘that’s kind of the whole idea.’

\*\*\*

On Thursday, I took Ruby to Clarissa.

I hadn’t wanted to. I really didn’t want to face that man again – it was too upsetting and emotionally draining. Sean was going to do it, but then an important meeting came up – ‘This one could be it, Rebecca,’ he’d said.

I smiled, and told him that of course he couldn’t miss it. But the reality was that I was starting to lose faith in Sean’s dream, the app that would make our fortune. There’d been too many meetings that ‘could be it’, and too many disappointments. And with the way things were, I needed to find a way back to painting to keep things running smoothly at home.

So I asked Eugenie to take Ruby to the appointment.

‘I would, Rebecca,’ she said, ‘but there’s something you need to think about.’

‘What’s that?’ I’d found myself more open to advice from Eugenie than I was from other people.

‘You think of Clarissa as your friend, but she’s not. She’s an officer of the court and she’s there to observe you all, not just Ron Buckley.’

‘I know that,’ I said, feeling defensive.

‘So I think it’s important you show her that you’re putting Ruby first,’ she said. ‘Take Ruby today, and show that even though you hate Ron and it’s awkward, you’ll do what’s best for Ruby.’

I sighed and agreed, which is how I came to take Ruby.

\*\*\*

We arrived early, and settled into Clarissa’s small waiting room. I hoped that Ron Buckley would be late, that he’d show himself to be unreliable, but he arrived a few minutes after us.

‘Hello,’ he said to me.

I nodded. ‘Hi.’

He bent down and looked at Ruby. ‘Hello, Ruby-Mae.’

Ruby looked at him and then at me. ‘Him again,’ she observed.

I laughed and to my surprise Ron laughed too. ‘Him again,’ I agreed. ‘I guess he really likes playing with you.’

Before Ruby could respond, Clarissa’s door opened, and a child came out with her mother. I could immediately see there was something strange about the child – she was looking at her feet and flapping her arms next to her sides.

Clarissa looked around. ‘Rebecca,’ she said, ‘would you mind keeping an eye on Amelia for two minutes while I chat to her mom?’

‘Sure,’ I said, although I wasn’t really sure how to go about watching this child.

‘Just let her be,’ the mother said with a wan smile. ‘If she tries to go through a door, stand in her way and she’ll turn around.’

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘I think I can manage.’

The mother smiled, and followed Clarissa back into her playroom, and Ron apparently saw this as an opportunity to show what a nice guy he was.

‘Well hello, Amelia,’ he said.

Ruby looked at him, and then at Amelia, whose arm-flapping had suddenly increased in speed.

‘I don’t think she likes talking,’ observed Ruby.

‘She just wants to play, don’t you, Amelia?’ said Ron, reaching out a hand.

Amelia started making a low, soft keening noise. She still didn’t look at anyone.

‘Ron,’ I said, ‘I think she’s autistic. Please just leave her alone like her mother asked.’

Ron looked at me and then back at Amelia. Then he sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. ‘Autistic, huh?’ he said.

I nodded. ‘Or something like that.’

‘They should just put kids like that down,’ he observed, looking at her coldly. ‘Waste of oxygen. Waste of white skin.’ He paused. ‘Although I suppose I shouldn’t say that to you. No offence. Just that these retarded kids give me the heebies,’ he said, as if I would agree with him.

I was so stunned I couldn’t speak. For a moment, when we’d both laughed with Ruby, I’d actually thought I’d misjudged Ron Buckley.

Before I could say anything, Clarissa came out of the playroom, followed by Amelia’s mother, who looked like she’d been crying. When she saw that Amelia was keening, she shot me an accusatory look.

‘I’m so sorry. This gentleman didn’t quite understand.’ I indicated Ron, feeling like the class tattletale, pleased to have someone to pin the blame on but embarrassed that at my age I felt the need to.

‘Ron and Ruby, please come through,’ Clarissa said before Ron could defend himself, but he shot Amelia a look of revulsion before he followed Ruby into Clarissa’s office.

‘I’m really very sorry,’ I said to Amelia’s mother again. ‘I tried to stop him but he’s a doos.’

She smiled weakly. ‘The thing I’ve learnt in the last few years,’ she said, ‘is that most people don’t listen or understand. He’s probably not a doos – just a person who can’t imagine that you can still love a child like this.’

‘I’m not sure he’s a person who can love anyone,’ I said.

As Amelia’s mom left, I felt strangely bereft. I had an hour to wait before Ruby was finished with her session, so I stepped outside and phoned Eugenie to tell her the latest horrific story about Ron Buckley. At the end of the conversation, Eugenie was quiet.

‘Are you still there?’ I said.

‘Rebecca ...’ she said slowly, ‘what if we plant the idea in Ron’s head that there’s something wrong with Ruby?’

‘Well, there clearly isn’t,’ I said.

‘*I* know that. But Ron knows nothing about children,’ said Eugenie. ‘And clearly very little about things like autism, from what you are saying.’

‘I could mention the play therapy ...’ I said, becoming excited. ‘And kids do pretty crazy things sometimes, but he won’t know that’s normal. Do you think it’d work?’ At this point I knew I would do anything to make Ron leave Ruby alone.

Eugenie sighed. ‘Well, we still don’t know what the hell he wants from all of this. But it’s worth a try.’

‘We can’t tell anyone, Eugenie,’ I said. ‘It could look really bad.’ I paused. ‘It *is* really bad.’

‘We won’t tell anyone,’ agreed Eugenie. ‘Not Sean, not Lerato and definitely not Clarissa or Marilyn.’

‘Agreed,’ I said. ‘But I’m still not sure about this.’

‘Rebecca,’ said Eugenie, ‘sometimes you have to do whatever is necessary. Life isn’t always black and white, good and bad. Sometimes you have to cross a line to make good things happen.’

I realised that Eugenie was right – it was time to stop being naïve. It was time to step up to the plate and do whatever was necessary to save Ruby.

Having made my decision, I felt a frisson of energy that I hadn’t known for weeks. I sat in the waiting room, rubbing the baby bump I now sported and planning what I could say when Ron and Clarissa emerged. I had to be subtle, but not so subtle that Ron missed it.

There was a shelf of books standing in the corner, so I leapt up to scan the titles. *Coping with Your Disturbed Child* – that would do the trick.

When Ron and Clarissa came out, Ruby holding Clarissa’s hand, I was absorbed in my book. I looked up, as if surprised at where the time had gone. Carefully, I placed the book on the chair, title up. ‘Interesting,’ I said, tapping the cover. ‘Such useful advice.’

‘I think we’ll have the next session at your place, Rebecca,’ said Clarissa. She was businesslike, but sounded tired. ‘Ruby didn’t really like it here.’

‘No problem,’ I said, probably sounding manic as I thought of all the subtle clues I could scatter around the house. ‘Some children find being out of their comfort zone very hard,’ I added. ‘Very disturbing.’

Clarissa looked at me with a puzzled furrow between her eyes. ‘It’s nothing to worry about, Rebecca,’ she said.

I gave a deep sigh. ‘I can’t help worrying about Ruby,’ I said. ‘But I’m sure her play therapist can help with this.’

‘That’s a good idea, Rebecca,’ said Clarissa. ‘Will you be comfortable with me giving her a call?’

Ron’s brow, I noticed, furrowed slightly.

‘Of course,’ I said. ‘We all have to work together to give Ruby the help she needs. It’s an ongoing project.’ I wondered if I was laying it on too thick. ‘Anyhoo,’ I said, using an expression I despise, ‘we must be off now. I have to stop at the chemist for Ruby’s meds.’

And we left quickly, pushing past Ron in our haste. I was so delighted with myself that I kept laughing in the car as I replayed the conversation, and Ruby started laughing too, although she didn’t know why.

‘Is it funny because that man is ugly, Mommy?’ she eventually asked.

Had she noticed that she’d called me ‘Mommy’? Whether or not she’d done it intentionally, it had slipped out, and I laughed again from sheer joy.

‘*Is* it?’ she insisted.

‘That man has many problems, Rubes,’ I said, ‘but ugly is not one of them.’

When I got home, I phoned Eugenie and told her how well it had gone.

‘You’re a genius,’ I told her. ‘I owe you. In fact, I’m going to do a painting for you.’

Eugenie laughed. ‘Rebecca, I love your paintings but I know you’re struggling to paint – if you manage one, it certainly mustn’t be for me.’

But I’d already pictured a painting for Eugenie to hang in the entrance to the shop. A Rebecca Williams Dog doing a pole dance – I could see it perfectly.

‘Eugenie,’ I said, ‘I’ve got to go paint. Chat later.’

With a shout to Gugu to watch the girls, I all but ran to my studio. Should the dog be pole dancing, or lying on a chaise longue in sexy lingerie? Both were vivid to me and I couldn’t decide, so I took out two canvases and started prepping them both. While the first layers of paint dried, I did some sketches – naughty dogs flowed from my pen, and I couldn’t sketch fast enough.

‘I’m onto something,’ I SMSed Joanne.

And to Eugenie: ‘I think you might have saved my career.’

Clarissa phoned me that evening as I sat back with a cooldrink, thinking about the work I’d managed that afternoon. It was good. I was happy.

‘Rebecca,’ she said, ‘I’m a bit worried that you are overreacting to this situation. Ruby-Mae is fine, you know. You don’t have to worry.’

‘I’m not worrying, Clarissa,’ I said. ‘Just making sure that she gets all the care and attention she needs.’

Clarissa was quiet for a moment. ‘I guess I can’t fault that,’ she said. ‘But don’t get all crazy on me.’

‘Don’t worry,’ I said. ‘No craziness here.’

‘What meds is she on?’

‘What?’

‘This afternoon you said you had to fetch her meds. What meds?’

‘Oh ... she’s had a snotty nose. Just picked up some nasal spray.’

‘She seemed okay to me today,’ Clarissa said, but then laughed. ‘You made it sound so serious.’

I tried a laugh. ‘Really? No, no, just a snotty nose.’

‘Okay,’ she said. ‘I’ll see you at your place on Tuesday.’

\*\*\*

But I couldn’t make it on the Tuesday. I’d painted all weekend like a woman possessed, while Sean watched the girls. Eugenie had relieved us on the Sunday, taking them out for the afternoon – ‘Rest,’ she’d told me.

But I couldn’t. I had to paint.

By Monday, I was feeling ill, tired and nauseous, and I became frantic with the idea that my crazed painting had hurt the baby. The only time the gynae could see me was that Tuesday afternoon, so Sean agreed to come home to hand over to Clarissa and Ron, and Eugenie said that she would take Amy out.

I returned after my appointment to a house that almost seemed normal. Sean told me all about it later that evening after the girls were asleep. My feet were up on a stool and I was drinking tea because the doctor had told me to take it easy for a few days, to limit my painting to a few hours, and to sit whenever possible while I worked – ‘We don’t want to rob the world of your work entirely,’ he’d said, and I’d had a vision of a pregnant Dog for his office wall.

Sean and Ruby had been doing a puzzle together on the floor when Ron had arrived early. Gugu had let him in.

‘Oh,’ he’d said, taking in the scene. ‘I didn’t realise you’d be here. And so ... involved.’ Sean said that he made ‘involved’ sound both ludicrous and suspicious.

‘I see myself as Ruby’s father,’ Sean had answered simply, standing up.

‘*I’m* Ruby’s father,’ Ron had said.

Ruby had looked up at the two men. ‘My mommy’s dead,’ she’d said conversationally.

Then Ron had stepped right up to Sean and said, ‘Don’t fuck with me.’

Sean’s response was that he’d be sure to mention what language Ron considered appropriate in front of a child when we were next in court. And luckily, Clarissa had rung the doorbell at that point.

When Clarissa came into the house, Sean had taken her aside and asked if Ron could wait outside for her in future, to which she had agreed.

‘I didn’t like him in our space without her,’ he said to me.

Sean thought that Ron would’ve taken that minute alone with Ruby to show what a good father he was, but when Clarissa and Sean had walked back into the room, Ruby was playing on her own, and Ron was standing in front of the Picasso.

Apparently Ron had asked if it was real, and Sean had just said, ‘Yes.’ Then Ron had said something about that it must be valuable, which would normally be Sean’s cue to explain that it wasn’t really. Instead he said, ‘Yes. We can afford it.’

‘I don’t know, Rebecca,’ Sean said now, leaning forward to rub my feet, which were still propped up on the stool. ‘It’s so childish, but I just wanted him to know that I could afford a Picasso and he couldn’t.’

‘Testosterone,’ I said. ‘You were having a stand-off like two male lions.’

‘And do you think I won?’ he asked.

I sighed. ‘I think the fight is far from over.’ Sean looked so defeated that I added, ‘But at least you can afford a Picasso.’

‘It’s not that valuable,’ said Sean.

‘It is to me, my love.’

But the next week, when I again saw *About!* in my local shop, I knew that Ron had won this round of the battle.

*Suspected of abuse!* screamed the headline, with a photo of Sean holding Ruby’s hand. The picture looked like one of those taken of Hollywood stars trying to enjoy a private holiday: blurry and furtive.

My hand shook as I took the magazine off the shelf.

*Man who seeks to adopt little Ruby has dark secret*, said the strapline on the cover. I opened the magazine, and read: *A case of child molestation was opened against Sean Prince, then 18. His 11-year-old cousin was the victim. The case was dropped with no explanation. Now Sean has adopted one little girl and seeks to adopt another.*

The article went on to rehash the previous article, saying nothing more about the charge until the end: *Is Sean Prince a suitable man to be given care of two minor girls? Ron Buckley, Ruby’s biological father, thinks not. ‘It’s not natural to want a child that isn’t yours unless you’ve got some agenda,’ he says. ‘Now we know this guy’s agenda.’* The article ended with another plea for donations.

I dropped the magazine, and made it to the pavement before I vomited.

\*\*\*

Sean was devastated.

‘Maybe I should move out,’ he said. ‘So nobody takes the girls away.’

I didn’t know what to say. I knew Sean was innocent – he’d told me about the dropped charges ages ago. The cousin who’d actually abused the cousin had even done jail time. But I hesitated in responding because I knew my number-one job was to protect my girls.

Maybe Sean was waiting for me to immediately say no, he must stay, but instead, I said, ‘Let’s see what Marilyn and Clarissa think.’

Sean looked at me like I’d kicked him.

‘Sean,’ I said, reaching out to touch him, ‘I have to protect the girls. And if there’s any possibility that they might be taken away ...’

Sean nodded. ‘Yes,’ he said eventually. ‘I just didn’t realise you’d be so keen.’

Can a marriage ever recover from this? I wondered.

But when we spoke to Marilyn, she dismissed the idea of Sean moving out without a thought. ‘So, the charges were dropped and it was all a misunderstanding?’ she asked when we’d explained what had happened.

‘Yes,’ said Sean. ‘But that’s not what people will think.’

‘The courts are not in the business of what people think, Sean,’ said Marilyn. ‘They’re in the business of objective facts. And the objective fact here is that this is a huge nothing.’

‘And what about me?’ said Sean. ‘What about the fact that everyone I know and everyone I don’t know now thinks I’m a paedophile? Nothing’s going to fix that.’

Marilyn nodded. ‘I agree. Usually I tell clients to ignore this sort of trash, but I think in this case we should do two things. One – they must print your version. Again, I don’t usually recommend engaging with this sort of media, but we, or rather you, need an article setting the record straight. Especially as there are now fools out there sponsoring Ron Buckley. Two – I want to threaten him with a defamation case. I’m not sure we should actually go through with it, but let’s see where we get with a threat.’

‘I don’t want to be seen to be going after the money,’ said Sean.

‘Anything we get out can be put into a trust for Ruby,’ said Marilyn decisively, and Sean nodded.

‘I can live with that.’

Clarissa was similarly dismissive of our concerns.

‘Honestly,’ she said, ‘I’m also thinking of suing. What does it say about me if I’d allowed a known sex offender to adopt a child? *Obviously* you and Sean had police clearance before you adopted Amy. It’s shoddy journalism. Shoddy.’

We told her what Marilyn had said about threatening a lawsuit, and holding the money for Ruby.

‘I like that,’ said Clarissa. ‘I’ll give her a call and add a separate threat from my side.’

We were all a bit high with all the talk of law suits and our story in *About!*, but when Sean and I climbed into bed at the end of that day, there was silence between us.

# Friends

Marilyn put everything into motion the next morning, but the tide turned even quicker than we expected.

While I was driving back from school, I tuned in to a morning talk show to take my mind off what was happening. Dropping the children had been stressful because the teachers had obviously both read the article. Trish had called me aside.

‘I’m taking it everything’s under control?’ she’d said.

‘The whole story is fabricated,’ I’d told her, and explained about the misunderstanding and the dropped charges, and that neither the lawyer nor the social worker were concerned.

‘Perhaps you could give me the social worker’s number?’ Trish had said.

I’d done so, but I felt hurt. And if things were hard for me, I wondered what Sean must be going through.

The radio did nothing to distract me, because to my horror they were discussing the article.

‘That man is a disgrace,’ a strident woman’s voice was saying. ‘It’s shocking.’

I thought they were talking about Sean, and I reached for the switch to turn it off.

‘Which man?’ came the familiar voice of the show’s well-known host, a woman who had interviewed me in the past. ‘Sean Prince or Ron Buckley?’

‘Ron Buckley,’ said the woman, her voice thick with hatred. ‘He’s basically saying that anyone who adopts a girl-child is unnatural and – to quote him – must have “an agenda”.’

‘And that’s obviously not correct,’ said the host in the mild voice she uses when things are getting out of hand.

‘At Adoption South Africa, we find this offensive,’ said the woman caller. ‘Adoption is a natural phenomenon, also seen in the animal kingdom. And people like the Princes – who have adopted one child and are providing this orphaned girl with a home – are the salt of the earth.’

‘But the child isn’t an orphan, from what I understand,’ said the host. ‘She has a biological father.’

‘The sort of man who sells his story to *About!*,’ snorted the caller.

This was exactly what Sean and I were worried about – if we told our story to *About!*, then we’d be no better. There was no winning with this.

Just as the radio host announced that she’d be taking more calls on the topic, my phone rang. I don’t usually answer while I’m driving, but I was hoping it might be Sean.

‘Hello,’ said a man’s voice I didn’t recognise. ‘Is this Rebecca Prince?’

I turned off the radio. ‘Yes,’ I said.

‘It’s James Mthetwa here. I’m the producer for Breakfast Banter on —’

‘Yes,’ I interrupted him. ‘I was just listening.’

‘Ah,’ he said. ‘Fabulous, then I don’t have to explain. Would you be willing to talk to us now?’

I thought for a minute. Breakfast Banter was regarded as a serious chat show, and the host, Thandi, was a fair and sensible woman. This would be far better than talking to *About!*, and the opportunity had just fallen straight into my lap.

‘Will you make it clear that you contacted me, and not the other way around?’ I asked, pulling over the car to the side of the road and switching on my hazards.

‘Sure thing,’ said James. ‘Fabulous.’

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘I’ll do it.’

‘Fabulous. Putting you through,’ he said with hardly a pause.

The line changed to a streaming of the radio show. I was glad that my painting had given me the chance to speak on radio – I knew a bit of what I was doing, although I wished I’d had a chance to talk to Sean and Marilyn beforehand.

‘The fabulous James has just told me that we’ve managed to get hold of Rebecca Prince, who has agreed to speak to us,’ said Thandi, her live-radio voice coming to me through my phone.

I smiled inwardly. At least I now understood why she always referred to her producer as ‘the fabulous James’.

‘Thank you for agreeing to speak to us on such short notice, Rebecca,’ said Thandi.

‘It’s a pleasure,’ I said. ‘Thank you for making the effort to get both sides of the story.’

‘So, let’s start at the beginning. You and Sean have an adopted daughter?’

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘We had fertility problems and eventually adopted Amy.’

‘Who is black?’ said Thandi.

I knew I had to handle this carefully – put too much weight on Amy’s colour and we are racist, but dismiss it and we are robbing her of her birthright.

‘Well, she’s mixed race,’ I said. ‘We help Amy celebrate that she is black, but in our eyes she is first and foremost our daughter.’

‘That’s lovely,’ said Thandi, and I felt myself relaxing. Too soon. ‘And when you adopted Amy,’ she continued, ‘were you aware of Sean’s so-called criminal history?’

Even though I knew that this was the whole point, I felt ambushed. But early in my career, Joanne had advised me to always know what my main point was in an interview, and to repeatedly get that across.

‘The most important thing to understand about those charges,’ I said, ‘is that they were only laid as the result of a misunderstanding. They were dropped completely and laid later against the correct person. There has never been any question that Sean molested anybody. The charges were dropped, and they were originally laid in error.’

‘Some people would say ‘no smoke without a fire’?’

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘There was a fire – a child had indeed been molested. But Sean was not the one who did it, and the only reason he was ever accused was a miscommunication. As soon as the child’s parents realised this, they dropped the charges and apologised.’

‘And how do you feel about Ron Buckley, Ruby’s biological father?’ asked Thandi.

I was silent for a moment. My real feelings would obviously not be appropriate, so I decided to go back to the source.

‘It’s difficult,’ I said. ‘Ruby’s mother, Lilith, was very clear that she did not want Ron Buckley to be part of Ruby’s life, and she had good reasons, which I’m not prepared to talk about on radio. Her will is also crystal clear on this point. That being said, I have to consider that Lilith might have been wrong, and that having Ron in Ruby’s life might be good for her.’

‘You can’t like that he has implied that adoption is unnatural?’ said Thandi.

‘Well, that’s simply ridiculous, isn’t it?’ I said, knowing that Ron wasn’t alone in this view. ‘Any thinking person knows that in the overwhelming majority of cases, abusers don’t adopt their child victims ... But maybe we have to consider that Ron is trying to protect his child.’

‘Do you really think that?’ asked Thandi.

‘I have to consider it,’ I said, ‘because the only other conclusion is that Ron is a deliberately destructive man. And that would be very worrying.’

‘And what about him selling his story to *About!*?’ asked Thandi.

‘It’s not something my husband and I would do,’ I said, ‘but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong.’

Thandi laughed at that point. ‘Diplomatically put,’ she said.

I allowed myself a small laugh. ‘Thank you,’ I said. ‘But this has been part of the learning journey for me – recognising that there are different ways of doing things in life, and that mine is not the only way.’

‘But you do think that Ruby should be with you and your family?’

‘It’s what her mother wanted,’ I said. ‘It’s a stable family environment with people who know and love her, and who have the means to give her advantages. Yes, I think it’s in Ruby’s best interests to stay with Sean and me.’

The first person who got through to me after the radio interview was Marilyn. ‘You were amazing,’ she told me.

‘Really?’ I was still sitting in my car at the side of the road, shaking, convinced that I’d messed up.

‘Listen,’ said Marilyn, ‘if this whole being-a-famous-artist thing doesn’t pan out, there’s a job waiting for you at my firm fielding media calls. *That’s* how good you were.’

I laughed. ‘I can’t think of a worse job.’

‘Pity,’ said Marilyn. ‘You’re a natural.’

Sean was next. And he didn’t phone, like I would have expected – he sent a text message: ‘I only caught the last bit when Clarissa SMSed me,’ he said. ‘You were good.’

\*\*\*

Media reactions the next day were mixed. The story made all the major newspapers and radio chat shows, and there seemed to be three reactions: outrage over Ron Buckley’s implications about adoption; slightly less outrage that poor innocent Sean had been defamed; and then a view that we were totally in the wrong, that Sean was clearly a pervert, and that we were using our vast fortune to cover up the real story.

The frenzy might have disturbed us, except that the day held something far more frightening: Ron Buckley brought an urgent application to the High Court to have Ruby removed from our care. He asked for custody, alternatively that she be placed in a place of safety. Our date in the High Court was set for three days’ time.

‘A foster home if you’re lucky, or a children’s home,’ Marilyn confirmed when she delivered the bad news in her office that morning, having called us in early.

‘That’s not going to happen, right?’

‘It’s a stupid and weak case,’ she said, and I relaxed slightly. ‘But the judge hearing the applications this week has a bit of a history of doing strange things with children. Rumour has it she was abused as a child; she’s very neurotic. We need a watertight report from Clarissa, and we need affidavits from every character witness we can think of.’

Sean and I spent the next hour in Marilyn’s office going through our phones and coming up with our most impressive of friends, and friends who’d be prepared to vouch for us under oath. Marilyn assured us that her strategy would work.

After we’d come up with our list, Sean, sitting beside me, became very quiet.

‘Should I move out now?’ he said.

‘No,’ Marilyn said decisively. ‘That will look like an admission. Stay put.’

And Sean sat up a bit straighter. ‘Marilyn, draft those adoption papers at the same time,’ he said, ‘and send them to Ron’s lawyer. Tell them that anytime they want to sign, they can.’

I nodded vigorously. I’d been thinking too, and I’d also had an idea.

Marilyn looked at both of us. ‘I’m struggling to figure out how you guys think you can get him to go from asking for full custody to agreeing to an adoption,’ she eventually said.

‘You never know,’ said Sean.

‘Things happen,’ I said.

Marilyn nodded. ‘Okay,’ she said. ‘I just hope you two know what you’re doing.’

\*\*\*

Afterwards I stopped by at Eugenie’s sex shop and, as she decorously sipped a cup of tea, I told her what was happening.

‘I guess I’m not on that list of fine upstanding citizens,’ she said with a laugh.

‘No,’ I admitted, rolling my eyes around the red-lit room. ‘But there *is* something I need you to do. Something far more important.’ And I told Eugenie my idea.

‘It might work,’ she said when I’d finished. ‘I’m in.’

I had to hope that my plan would work, because I could see a future in which the court said that Ruby-Mae must be with her father. Nobody seemed to care that Ron had abused Lilith or that Lilith had specifically said that Ron must not be allowed access to Ruby. So I would do what Marilyn had told us to do: find Ron’s button and push it. And the one thing I was sure about was that Ron Buckley wouldn’t want the care of a disturbed child. Hell, I wasn’t sure he even wanted the care of a perfect child – but Eugenie and I would be sure to make the prospect of looking after Ruby as unattractive as possible.

I didn’t know what Sean would think about this, so I decided not to tell him. He seemed to have utmost faith that justice would prevail – why else would he have given the inexplicable instruction for the adoption papers to be drawn up, just as it looked like Ruby might be taken away from us?

*I* knew that Ron Buckley wasn’t sitting around worrying about whether his behaviour was ethical or not. If I was fighting fire, I would use fire.

At the lawyers’ office, Sean and I had split our list of people to phone for an urgent affidavit. If they agreed, we had to pass on their details to Marilyn. Sean had the bulk of the list because he could make the calls from work, and I really wanted to spend all afternoon with the girls after school.

In fact, I felt an urgent need to spend time with Ruby. The thought of her being taken away from us – for any amount of time – was absolutely shattering. I felt like I had in those weeks after we met Amy, but before we were allowed to bring her home, to call her ‘ours’. I felt like the whole fabric of my family was in doubt. I couldn’t say so to Sean, who was so broken by the allegations of sexual abuse, and yet so strangely sure that we would win. To him, I pretended complete confidence.

Once I was home, I had just a bit of time before I left to fetch the girls, so I started my list with the easy people: Lerato (‘respected lawyer’) said she would do anything to help, and Joanne (‘Business woman’) offered to do several affidavits. But after that there were some strange reactions.

‘Well, I don’t really know, do I?’ said my friend Ashley, who we’d included because she is a teacher at a well-known girls’ school. ‘I can’t actually say that I think Sean is not a danger to children.’

‘For God’s sake, Ash,’ I said, her reaction taking me completely by surprise: it had never crossed my mind that she wouldn’t agree. ‘You know Sean. You’ve left your kids here for playdates.’

‘Maybe that was a mistake,’ said Ashleigh sweetly, and I wondered how I’d never noticed how irritating her voice was.

‘Maybe our friendship is a mistake,’ I said, slamming down the phone.

After Ashleigh, I took a few deep breaths and made successful calls to our dentist and GP. I phoned the girls’ school, and Maureen was thrilled to be able to help.

Then I phoned Janine, my old university friend, who was now a well-known radio personality and MC, and who’d spent many hours eating, drinking and laughing at our home.

‘You’ve got to understand, Becs,’ she said. ‘I can’t get involved in something like this. My name has currency.’

‘Exactly, Janine,’ I said. ‘We need that currency.’

‘Sorry, Becs,’ she said. ‘I just can’t do this.’

‘I hate being called Becs,’ I said, for lack of any better response.

Janine had always been calm and rational – which was probably why she’s so good at what she does. ‘If you’re going to ask people to do something like this,’ she said, ‘you can’t get upset if they say no. It’s a big ask, and we should be able to say no without losing your friendship.’

I sighed. ‘That’s easy for you to say, Janine.’

‘I know,’ she said, ‘but I’m gonna make like this never happened. In my books, we’re still friends.’

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Bye.’

‘Bye, Becs. Chat soon.’

My phone rang almost immediately after that, and the caller ID showed Sean.

‘How’s it going?’ I asked him.

‘Rebecca,’ he said, ‘is this happening to you? People are saying no?’

‘Ashleigh and Janine,’ I answered.

‘Well, of the fifteen people I’ve phoned, five have said no. I can’t fucking believe it.’ He sounded like he might cry.

‘I guess if nothing else, we’re finding out who our true friends are,’ I said.

‘The worst is, some of them are so rational that I actually understand,’ he said.

I thought about Janine. ‘I know what you mean. But think about it: have you asked anyone who you wouldn’t have been happy to vouch for? Who you wouldn’t help in this situation?’

‘No,’ said Sean, his voice stronger. Then he gave a small laugh. ‘Okay, maybe I wouldn’t vouch for Ed. Irony is, he was happy to do it.’ Ed is Sean’s ex-boss. A pillar of the community – who we happen to know has a slight problem with coke and prostitutes.

‘Listen,’ I said, ‘we still have lots of great people supporting us. And we’re finding out who we can trust.’ I paused, and then because this was the most we’d actually said to each other in days, I said, ‘Sean, why did you want the adoption papers drawn up?’

‘Listen, I gotta go,’ he said. ‘I’ll see you later.’

The next blow came from the front page of the daily paper, which had been thrown into our driveway that morning, but which I only picked up when I arrived home with the girls at lunchtime. Previously known for its serious approach to news and current affairs, the newspaper had been slowly sliding into the tabloid world. I’d actually heard the editor being interviewed on the radio a few months before: ‘Print media is challenging. Sensation sells.’

And they’d certainly achieved their goal with that day’s front page.

Sean’s mother was pictured looking somehow both glamorous and vulnerable, and above it said the headline: *Sean Prince’s Mother Speaks Out*. And below: *Angela Prince says Sean is not the family man he would have the court believe*.

I sent the girls inside with Gugu and read the article standing in the driveway, with a weight in my stomach. Angela painted a picture of Sean as an uncaring and distant son: ‘He hasn’t called for months,’ she was quoted as saying. ‘We didn’t even know about this latest child.’ On the topic of the sexual offence allegation, she said, ‘We never uncovered the full story. Sean didn’t speak about it.’ And to top it off, ‘Rebecca is a cold woman. She’s obsessed with fame and has no space in her heart for family.’

As with the other articles, there was probably nothing we could actually attack. It was true that Sean never called, it was true that she knew nothing of Ruby or the baby I was carrying, and it was true that I had no space in my heart for her.

But the final straw about this article, the thing that made me wonder if anything would ever feel safe again, was the photograph of me. It was the one that Rose had taken all those months before, in the park, with Amy clambering over me. They’d edited Amy out of the picture, so it was just me, looking tired and pissed off. ‘Rebecca Prince, wannabe mother,’ said the caption. That picture that Rose had used to make me laugh, had now been used to hurt me.

My phone rang and I answered, expecting Sean. But it was James from the radio show again. ‘Up to an interview about this, hun?’ he asked.

This time I was more cautious. ‘Phone me in an hour,’ I said, walking slowly up the driveway, back into the house.

‘Fabulous,’ said James.

I phoned Sean, who hadn’t seen the paper and who became almost apoplectic with rage when I read him the story. Then I phoned Marilyn, and we agreed on what I would say on radio.

By the time James phoned me back, I had holed myself up in my studio, away from the girls, and the only place I could guarantee some quiet. I said that I’d make a short statement.

‘Fabulous, hun,’ he said. ‘Fabulous.’ I wondered if ‘hun’ had been added to his list of favourites, or if the endearment was just because I was now hot media property. ‘Hang on – you’ll be on in a sec.’

‘We’re speaking to Rebecca Prince,’ said Thandi as I came on air mere seconds later, ‘and she’s agreed to make a short statement about her mother-in-law’s attack on her and her husband in this morning’s article. Headline news, Rebecca,’ she continued. ‘Did you ever think that your mother-in-law would be headline news?’

I was ready with my prepared statement so I was somewhat thrown by the question. I took a deep breath. ‘No,’ I said. ‘It has really upset us.’

‘So what’s your take on this, Rebecca? Is it true that Sean is a terrible son?’

‘Basically, Thandi,’ I said, turning to the written statement I had in front of me, ‘it’s true that Sean and I have become estranged from Sean’s family. This is because of the extremely racist and non-accepting attitude she has had towards our daughter, Amy. Sean and I are not prepared to expose any of our children to that sort of person. Even if they are Sean’s parents.’

‘Those are strong words, Rebecca,’ said Thandi. ‘Do you want to flesh it out for us?’

‘I could give countless examples,’ I said. ‘But I’m not prepared to get involved in mud-slinging. At this point, all our energy is focused on keeping Ruby, and keeping both our daughters happy.’

‘So there you have it,’ said Thandi. ‘According to Rebecca Prince, her in-laws are racists and a bad influence on their children. Is it true, or is she playing the race card? Call in and tell us what you think.’

Suddenly I wanted to explain better, to go beyond the statement and make Thandi see what sort of person Angela really was, but it was too late: James was back on the line.

‘That was fabulous, hun. Thanks. I’m sure we’ll chat again. You have a fabulous day, hun.’

I made the mistake of listening to the studio radio after the interview. All sorts of people called in, and everyone had an opinion about my life and my choices. People said the most terrible things. One white woman phoned and said that, ‘with all due respect,’ nobody could ‘blame the mother-in-law for having trouble with a black grandchild’. Thandi took that woman apart, but I had a feeling that many people actually thought that way; more people than we had imagined or cared to imagine. Then a black woman phoned in and ranted about how we ‘had already stolen a child from a black family and now they want to steal this little white girl too’. Again, Thandi took her on, explaining patiently that Amy hadn’t been stolen, that her birth mother had abandoned her or given her up.

The final straw was when a voice came on the line that I recognised, and Thandi said that the caller had asked to stay anonymous but was a former friend of the family.

‘Rebecca Prince thinks she’s better than anyone,’ said the voice. ‘But she’s really a very average mother. Her adopted daughter is turning out to be a very average child. I can’t think why anyone would leave their child with her and I am starting to wonder if it all really happened like she says.’

The voice suddenly came into focus: Rose! I felt like I’d been hit.

‘Do you want to explain what you mean?’ said Thandi, but there was no answer, and after a few seconds Thandi said, ‘We seem to have lost anonymous from Johannesburg.’

I couldn’t listen any more. I turned off the radio, my hands shaking. I felt dirty and shamed and like I had let my children down. What had I done to Rose that she would turn on me like this? What steps had lead me to this place where my precious Amy and Ruby – a child entrusted to me by a dying woman – were now the fodder for tabloid reports and radio talk shows. I couldn’t believe that I had failed Amy so thoroughly, and so soon. It made me wonder if somewhere out there a young woman was listening, wondering if Amy was her baby.

That was the idea that broke me: the idea that all this publicity might make Amy’s birth mother regret giving her up. That, and the crushing idea in this moment of madness that Amy might in any way have been better off without us. Without me.

And that we might lose Ruby too.

All because of Ron Buckley.

After I turned off the radio, I took a few minutes to collect myself, taking great, deep breathes to stop myself from crying – or panicking. And then I phoned Eugenie.

We needed to go over our plan.

My afternoon with Ruby and Amy was lost.

# Court

On the day we went to the High Court to fight for Ruby, we left the girls with my mother. I’d decided to keep the girls out of school because I’d begun to worry about journalists finding them.

My mother was thrilled to look after them, and both girls were delighted to be spending the day at Granny’s house. Interestingly, Ruby had called my mother ‘Granny’ from the moment she met her, although she’d still only called me ‘Mommy’ that once.

My mom hugged me close when I said goodbye. ‘You go get ’em,’ she whispered in my ear.

I thought about telling her my plan, but I knew the less people who knew, the better.

Eugenie came with us in our car. ‘Explain why again?’ Sean had asked that morning, as if I was yet again inconveniencing him.

‘Because I want her with me,’ I’d said. ‘She makes me feel better.’

But Sean had been distracted, walking in and out of the house. At one point, I thought I saw him putting a wrapped parcel in the boot of the car, and he insisted being the last one in the house to lock up.

‘What was that?’ I asked as we reversed down the driveway.

‘What was what?’

‘What you put in the boot?’

‘Dunno what you’re talking about,’ he said. ‘Come on, we don’t want to be late.’

\*\*\*

When we got to the court, I tried to get Sean to come with me to find Marilyn, but Sean seemed to have an agenda of his own.

‘You go find Marilyn,’ he said starting off in the same direction as Eugenie, who’d gone off to fulfil her side of things. ‘I just want to go to the toilet.’

‘Love, I’m sure there’s a toilet this way too,’ I said.

‘Well, I want to go this way,’ he snapped. ‘Just let me be.’

I couldn’t argue without turning it into a fight, just when we needed to show the court a calm, united couple. And maybe, I thought, we weren’t as united as we used to be; maybe that was gone forever. But we did both want to keep Ruby.

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Well, join me as soon as you can. I have my phone.’

Marilyn was waiting near the designated court room. She explained what would happen, making sure I understood that the whole process would be based on the written papers and there would be no witnesses and cross examination, like on TV, unless the judge asked to hear from somebody. Then she introduced me to the advocate, a Jonathan Pratt, who would be presenting our case.

‘Don’t worry, Mrs Prince,’ he said. ‘We’re going to win this.’

He wasn’t what I’d have expected from an advocate. He was shorter than me, and seemed a bit uneasy, biting the side of his thumb as Marilyn spoke. But Marilyn had advised us that he was the best for this type of case, and had enjoyed great success before this particular judge. We had to trust her.

Marilyn asked, ‘Where’s Sean?’ just as I turned to look for him.

‘He went to the toilet,’ I said. ‘I think this has thrown him – he’s acting really strangely.’

‘It’s understandable,’ said Jonathan Pratt, pausing from chewing his thumb. ‘This is not an easy process for anyone.’

I liked Jonathan Pratt a bit better after that, though I thought wryly how, unlike Sean, at least *I* had made it to the court’s doors.

It was at that point that I looked down the passage and witnessed the bizarre sight of Ron Buckley, deep in conversation with his attorney, leading what looked like a pack of people: a man in a black gown who I assumed was his advocate; Eugenie, her bulk almost spanning the narrow passage; and Sean, a look of intense irritation on his face.

I knew what Eugenie was up to – and she gave me a quick nod of her head as they drew level with us. But Sean glared at me.

‘What?’ I asked.

‘Nothing,’ he said. ‘This is just all so irritating.’

I had no idea what aspect of the nightmare Sean was finding simply ‘irritating’, but I had a plan to execute so I let it go. I sidled up to Marilyn.

‘Do you have a copy of the adoption papers?’ I hissed at her.

Marilyn looked at me over her half-moon glasses. ‘Yes, Rebecca,’ she said, ‘I do. But only to keep you two crazy people happy because – and I’m saying this for the last time – they are completely irrelevant at this stage.’

I smiled. ‘That’s what you think.’

Marilyn looked at me again, and then turned theatrically to Jonathan Pratt. ‘They used to be the most balanced, reasonable clients,’ she observed.

Meantime, Ron Buckley was moving into the court room and Eugenie almost squashed a small blonde lawyer in her effort to follow close behind him. The lawyer – unbelievably – managed to remain at Ron’s side, but I was relieved to see when we walked into court ourselves that Eugenie had planted herself right next to Ron, a sheen of sweat on her forehead.

Ron was deep in conversation with the small blonde lawyer, flashing his fake smile, his body language all invitation. But Eugenie appeared quite patient. Now that she was in position, she’d make it happen. I could have kissed her.

Sean, sitting next to me, was looking around the court with a scowl on his face. He spotted what looked like a reporter and his scowl deepened. He leant forward and tapped Marilyn, who was seated in front next to the advocate, on the shoulder. He whispered something to her, indicating the reporter. Marilyn glanced over, and nodded, whispering something to Advocate Pratt.

At that moment, a court orderly asked us all to rise, and the judge came in.

I don’t know what I’d been expecting, but Judge Mathibe was not it. For a start, despite her name, she was white. Also, she was tiny and, with her wild hennaed hair and too much blue eyeshadow, she looked like a small but brightly coloured bird. The court bowed to her and she bobbed her head back and sat. There was a rustle of gowns and papers as the rest of the court sat back down.

Judge Mathibe glanced at her papers. ‘Urgent application in the matter of Buckley versus Prince,’ she said, looking up. Her eyes were unusually large, the white showing all around the iris.

‘For the applicant, M’Lady,’ said the advocate for Ron Buckley, popping up for a moment.

Jonathan Pratt stood up and drew his robe around him. ‘For the respondent, M’Lady,’ he said. ‘And I beg the indulgence of the Court but I must start by moving for a removal of the press from the Court. This matter involves a minor and the reporting on it has already infringed both the rights of that minor and of my client.’

‘Mr Pratt,’ said the judge, ‘are you going to tire me today?’

‘I hope not, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, unphased.

The judge sighed. ‘Mr Hart, what is your take on this?’

The advocate for Ron Buckley stood up. ‘The press know the rules around reporting a court matter, M’Lady. And this matter is of public interest.’

Jonathan was on his feet again. It felt like a tennis match.

‘With all due respect, M’Lady. This matter is not of especial public interest per se, but has become a public spectacle thanks to the actions of the applicant, to which we refer in the papers. And the rights of the minor outweigh any considerations of public interest.’

Judge Mathibe steepled her hands and I awaited a wise and Solomonic pronouncement. In the end, however, she said, ‘Oh, stuff and nonsense, Mr Pratt. The press stay.’ She looked up and glowered at the court. ‘If anybody breaks the usual sub judice rules relating to minors, they will find their arses whipped with a contempt charge so fast they won’t know where to sell their next story.’

I was taken aback by her language and glanced around the court. One or two other people looked surprised, but the lawyers didn’t even flinch.

‘As the Court pleases, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan.

Advocate Hart stood up. ‘If I may, M’Lady, may we now proceed to the substance of the application? That is, if my learned friend has no more distractions for this court.’

At this, the judge donned a pair of large tortoiseshell glasses and peered through them at the lawyer. ‘Hmm,’ she observed, then took the glasses off again. ‘Proceed, Mr Hart, but spare me the playground innuendos.’

‘As the Court pleases, M’Lady,’ said Advocate Hart, as if his comments had been designed simply to amuse the judge. Perhaps they had.

He then launched into the case, setting out why Ron Buckley believed that Ruby should be removed from our care. I had read the papers but it felt different hearing all our perceived faults read out by this serious man. It frightened me how believable it all sounded.

‘Let us start,’ said Advocate Hart, ‘let us start with the history of this couple and children. In the first place, we see a history of alleged infertility.’

‘Are you implying they lied about that?’ interrupted the judge. I hadn’t realised she was allowed to interrupt; it’s not like that on American television.

‘Well, M’Lady, it’s not proven on the record.’

‘To what end would they lie about their fertility? And why would they put it on the record when it is wholly irrelevant?’

Advocate Hart shuffled his papers. ‘M’Lady,’ he mumbled, ‘it is a way in which a couple could get a child that was not their biological child. By pretending to be infertile.’

The judge raised her well-plucked eyebrows, but allowed him to continue. This seemed to give him some confidence and his voice grew louder.

‘And then they engage in a cross-racial adoption,’ he said. He looked around as if the implications of this were clear to everyone.

Judge Mathibe sat up straighter. She put the owl-like glasses back on. ‘Counsel,’ her was voice clipped, ‘let’s unpack what you are saying. Are you telling me adoption is a suspicious activity, or are you telling me that racially mixed families are a suspicious activity? Perhaps you should think very hard before you answer that, Counsel, because I am not sure there is an answer that will not antagonise this Court.’

I glanced over at our lawyers. This must surely be very good. Jonathan Pratt did indeed have a small smile, but Marilyn was frowning.

‘This Court misunderstands me,’ Advocate Hart said smoothly. ‘Neither adoption nor cross-racial adoption are suspicious activities. Indeed, they are laudable. But when performed by a man with a history of accusations of sexual offences, we have to look at everything through the warped glasses of a paedophile.’

Judge Mathibe looked down at her papers, and turned to something that she had flagged. ‘This history of sexual offences and alleged paedophilia takes the form of one charge that was dropped almost as soon as it was laid, am I right?’

‘That is all I am aware of,’ said Advocate Hart, managing to stress both the words ‘I’ and ‘aware’.

‘And you have seen, no doubt, that there is an affidavit from the alleged victim categorically clarifying that the Second Respondent was not the perpetrator?’

That affidavit had been a triumph for us. Sean’s cousin had gladly cooperated, saying that she still had nightmares about the misunderstanding – ‘Almost more so than the actual abuse,’ she’d said.

‘I have seen that,’ said Advocate Hart. ‘But this Court is as aware as I am of the unreliability of victims of abuse as witnesses. They may be intimidated and bullied.’

‘So now you are alleging that this ...’ The judge glanced at her papers. ‘This thirty-three year old woman has lied under oath about something that happened when she was eleven, and that the Second Respondent intimidated her into doing so.’

‘There is certainly no evidence before this Court of that,’ said Advocate Hart, who seemed very good at loading subtle implications into a sentence.

‘So,’ said Judge Mathibe, ‘let’s play a game where you stick to accusations that are actually germane to this hearing.’

‘As the Court pleases,’ said Advocate Hart.

His next leg of attack was that we barely knew Lilith or Ruby, and that it could not be in Ruby’s best interests to be with virtual strangers.

Marilyn smiled as he started down this argument, and elbowed Jonathan. The reason soon became apparent.

‘So you are telling me that it is not good for a child to be placed with virtual strangers?’ said the Judge.

‘Yes, that is correct, M’Lady. I refer you to annexure RB 17 on page 72 of M’Lady’s bundle, which is a social worker’s opinion on that very issue.’

‘Yet you are calling on this court to place the child with the Applicant, whom she first met approximately a month ago, whom she has never had an unsupervised visit with, and whom the mother specifically did not want her to be involved with?’

‘Indeed,’ said Advocate Hart, shifting his weight on his feet. ‘It is not the role of the Court to enforce or encourage a feud between the parents of the minor child, but to always go back to the best interests. And this court has held time and again that it is in the best interests of the child to have a relationship with both parents.’

Judge Mathibe nodded. ‘But,’ she said, ‘it is my understanding that no one has prevented the development of this relationship. It would seem that the Respondents and the Children’s Court have enabled supervised visits, as would be appropriate for the situation.’

‘The situation as it was, M’Lady. The situation as it was.’

He droned on for another half an hour, citing case law and being sure to say ‘best interests of the child’ at least every third sentence. The judge interrupted him a few more times, but seemed to become either less irritated or more bored. It was hard to tell.

Finally, Advocate Hart reached the end of his case. ‘And so, M’Lady, I submit that it will be in the best interests of the child to be returned to the arms of her father.’

The Judge sighed. ‘Not *returned* exactly, is it, Counsel?’

‘Placed, M’Lady. Placed in the arms of her father.’

The judge put on her glasses and peered at Ron Buckley. I wondered if she was evaluating his arms for the job.

‘We will have a five-minute adjournment before Counsel for the Respondents present their case,’ said Judge Mathibe. ‘And when I say five minutes, people, I actually mean five times sixty seconds. Nothing more.’ She left the court, with some accompanying standing and bowing by what I was thinking of as the audience.

Sean and I leant forward. ‘Did that go well for us?’ I asked.

‘It was okay,’ said Jonathan. ‘But make no mistake, she will put us through the same ringer. She is unbiased in her attacks.’

‘She seems a bit ... odd,’ said Sean. I nodded.

‘Oh, she is,’ said Marilyn. ‘And also very neurotic about making mistakes with children. The only good thing about it is that she genuinely tries to do what’s best for the child. Some of them really don’t care.’

‘So that’s good for us, right?’ said Sean.

‘The whole relationship-with-the-father thing is a strong argument,’ said Jonathan. ‘But you should win.’

I glanced back to where Ron was sitting. And there was Eugenie, working her magic. She was speaking to him, gesturing. He wasn’t answering, but he was looking at her and listening. He looked mystified.

I’d been hoping for terrified.

Too soon, the court orderly announced that the judge was back, and everybody stood up again. I noticed Jonathan wipe his hands on his gown, and realised he was nervous. I didn’t know if that was good or bad. I took Sean’s hand, which was also sweaty. But he squeezed mine, and in the midst of it all, that made me happy.

We all sat down after the rigmarole of bowing to the judge, and she said, ‘Counsel for the Respondents.’

Jonathan straightened his gown as he stood up.

‘M’Lady,’ he said, ‘I will try to keep it brief. This is a simple case and one in which the best interests of the child are clear. Rebecca and Sean Prince are caring parents, who, because of their circumstances, have been observed by a social worker for years. That social worker has provided a glowing report that is attached as annexure SP1 on page 113 of M’Lady’s bundle.’

‘I have a question for the social worker,’ said the judge. ‘Is she here today?’

Jonathan looked at me, and I indicated that Clarissa was sitting further down the bench from me. She gave him a little wave.

‘You can take instruction from her at this point ...’ The judge shuffled with her papers. ‘But ... Ms Grant, you should consider whatever you tell Mr Pratt as under oath.’

I glanced at Clarissa, who nodded.

‘Did the Respondents request a little girl when they adopted ...’ More shuffling. ‘Amy. When they adopted Amy.’

I hadn’t noticed that Clarissa had a file with her, which she now opened. I looked at Sean. We knew the answer, of course.

Clarissa leant forward and spoke to Jonathan.

‘M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, ‘it seems that the case file shows that the couple specified either gender on the papers, but that the Second Respondent mentioned in a consultation that if they had a choice, they would like a girl.’

Marilyn was frowning. Judge Mathibe made a note.

‘Thank you, Counsel, you may proceed.’

‘M’Lady, I will return to the point that you have just raised, but first I will finish my introductory remarks.’ He made a point about our financial stability, and about Lilith’s will and wishes. ‘And lastly, M’Lady, we have numerous affidavits confirming that the Respondents are respected in their community, and that the people who know them well would entrust them with a child.’

‘From their friends, Counsel,’ said the judge.

‘Indeed, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan. ‘Friends, colleagues and even the teacher at the school that the Respondents’ daughter Amy, and the minor child Ruby attend.’

Marilyn was pinching her nose.

‘Let me be honest, Counsel,’ said the judge. ‘Other than the teachers, these affidavits are of very little use to me. I have friends who would swear under oath that I’m thirty if I asked them nicely enough. What I want to know is how many of the people they approached for these affidavits refused to do one?’

Sean flinched next to me.

‘That is certainly a question, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan.

Judge Mathibe put her glasses on. By now we understood this as a sign of trouble.

‘Well, ask your client the question then, Counsel,’ she said. ‘And, Mr and Mrs Prince, I remind you that you should answer this as if you are under oath.’

Sean and I looked at each other and then leant forward to speak to Jonathan. ‘I had two or three on my list,’ I said.

Sean looked like he might cry. ‘At least five. But I’m not sure. I stopped counting it got so upsetting.’

‘Shit,’ muttered Jonathan under his breath. ‘The reasons?’

‘My feeling is just that people didn’t want to be dragged into it,’ I said. Sean nodded.

‘Good point. I’ll use that. M’Lady,’ he said, standing up, ‘my instructions are that about seven people indicated that they would not complete the affidavits. My clients indicated that these people did not want to become involved in a high-profile custody battle.’ It sounded so reasonable put like that and I felt sure the judge would drop the issue.

‘About seven people?’ said the judge.

‘My clients could not remember for sure, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan.

‘So they lost count of how many people would not say under oath that the Second Respondent is safe with children?’

‘They lost count of how many people refused to sign the affidavits, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, his voice smooth. ‘They don’t know all the reasons but some people indicated that they did not want any involvement in the publicity.’ Jonathan turned to us quickly, as if to confirm, and we both nodded. Jonathan turned back.

‘M’Lady, I realise the Court may not sully its mind with tabloid reporting, but the media have not been kind to my clients. We are in fact considering some instances of defamation. It is unsurprising that people are reluctant to become involved.’

‘You’d think they would want to help their friends if the Princes are really so faultless,’ said the judge.

‘With respect, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, ‘that is speculation.’

I expected the judge to look pissed off, but she actually nodded. Then she patted the papers. ‘In any event, I am not convinced that the affidavits of friends are of any weight.’

‘Be that as it may, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, ‘the affidavits from the school teachers, the social worker and the experts *are* of weight.’

‘Hmm.’ The judge now turned to another section of the pack of papers in front of her. ‘Am I right, Counsel,’ she said, ‘that it is accepted that the mother of this child never told the father that she was pregnant?’

‘That is what my clients understand,’ said Jonathan. ‘Although obviously that is based only on the mother’s word, and she is not here to cross examine. Similarly, they were told that the reason for this is that the father was extremely abusive to her. But again, M’Lady, we cannot interrogate this evidence.’

Marilyn gave a small smile. She’d explained the day before that evidence of Lilith’s abuse was almost impossible to introduce as it was hearsay and we had no collaborating evidence.

‘Did they see any evidence of this abuse?’

Apparently Marilyn had instructed Jonathan well on this point as he did not need to ask.

‘M’Lady, they did not know the mother of the child during the period that she was in a relationship with the Applicant. She shared her experiences with the First Respondent and another friend, and she had a scar on her arm that the First Respondent believed was from that abuse.’

‘And the other friend she told about this? Where is *her* affidavit?’

I felt cold.

Rose was the only person who had known Lilith during the time I had, and in the same capacity. Marilyn had tried to push me to contact Rose to ask for an affidavit, saying that it was worth it, but after hearing the call to the radio show I knew that Rose meant me nothing but harm. When I told Marilyn about it, she had to agree.

Now Marilyn leant over and whispered to Jonathan. After a moment, he spoke. ‘M’Lady, I am instructed that the person in question appears to have leaked photographs and inaccurate information to the media, and the Respondents do not wish to involve her.’

I noticed that the journalists were all scribbling this down, or checking that their little recording devices were still working.

‘Leaking?’ said the judge. ‘Leaking photographs? What is this, the CIA?’

Jonathan allowed himself a small smile. ‘M’Lady, perhaps leaking was the wrong word. And indeed, it implies that my clients have something to hide, which they don’t. Sharing. This person has shared personal information and photographs with the media.’

Marilyn whispered something to him.

‘I am instructed, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, ‘that she even brought a journalist to the funeral of the deceased mother.’

The judge tapped her fingers against the papers. ‘I think I want to hear from this person,’ she said. ‘But I also want to think about it. We will adjourn for twenty minutes.’

I turned to Sean in a panic. ‘If they call Rose —’ I said.

‘I know. There’s no predicting what she’ll say.’ Sean stood up. ‘I’m going to sort this out once and for all.’ He left the courtroom before I could say anything, and I was about to follow when Marilyn stopped me.

‘How bad would it be if they called her?’ she asked.

‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Before all this, Rose was a good friend, but she’s turned on us. And Marilyn ...’ I stopped. It was hard to say what had been bothering me since the idea of Rose testifying came up. ‘Marilyn, Rose is the person I used to complain about Sean to. You know, the usual wife complaints. But she could twist it.’ I felt sick.

‘We all bitch about our partners,’ she said. ‘You couldn’t have foreseen a situation like this.’

But I knew that if we lost Ruby because of that, I would blame myself forever.

I looked up and saw that Eugenie was frantically signalling to me from the other side of the court, so I went over.

‘I did it,’ Eugenie said. ‘I told him that I felt bad no one was warning him and that everyone was trying to trick him into taking Ruby, but I thought he should know that there’s a strong chance she’s retarded.’

‘And?’ I asked.

‘And he asked me a few questions and —’

‘Did he ask why we were spending all this money if we don’t really want her?’ We’d hoped that Ron’s stupidity would stop him seeing the flaw in our story.

‘He did,’ she said, ‘but I was inspired. I told him that legally he couldn’t give her back if he’d fought for her.’

‘Is that true?’ I said.

Eugenie’s great chest heaved with laughter. ‘I doubt it! He bought it though.’

‘Where’s he now?’

We both turned to look. Ron wasn’t in the courtroom.

‘Oh God,’ I said, with a sinking realisation. ‘Sean’s not here either.’

I ran out the court, not really sure where I was going, and found myself at the end of a passage, a dead end with a plate-glass window overlooking the car park.

And that’s how I saw them. Sean and Ron were standing next to our car, and Sean was reaching for something from the boot. I put my hand up to the window, willing him not to do anything stupid. Was it possible that Sean, my Sean, could become violent?

Sean handed over a parcel wrapped in brown paper.

Ron tore open the paper and looked into the parcel. After a moment Ron nodded and, to my complete surprise, the two men shook hands, and turned together to walk back into the court. Both had small smiles on their faces as they matched their strides and fell into a natural rhythm. It was the most unlikely sight I had ever seen.

\*\*\*

I caught up with them as they entered the courtroom. Ron’s arms were empty, and Sean almost pushed me aside in his hurry to get to Marilyn. I followed, feeling a bit like an abused puppy.

‘Give them the adoption papers,’ said Sean. ‘He’s going to sign.’

Marilyn looked up. ‘*What*?’

‘He’s going to sign.’

Marilyn looked at me, and my mind raced: had Eugenie and my plan worked? And what on earth had my husband just managed with his mysterious parcel? But I’d always trusted Sean, and I took his hand. Our fingers locked instantly.

‘Do what the man says,’ I said to Marilyn.

As Marilyn reached down for her briefcase, Ron’s attorney came over.

‘What the fuck is going on?’ he said. ‘What did you say to my client?’

‘I’m as mystified as you are,’ Marilyn said, bemused.

‘My advice to him is that he’s winning this thing,’ said the attorney, almost spitting.

‘That’s great,’ said Eugenie, who was standing nearby. ‘Because that will scare the living shit out of him.’

‘Your client never really wanted Ruby,’ added Sean. ‘He seems to have realised that.’

The attorney’s shoulders sagged. ‘You’re probably right,’ he said after a moment. ‘Give me the papers.’

Marilyn did so, and then watched him walk over to Ron. ‘Should I ask?’ she said.

‘No,’ Sean and I said in unison.

Jonathan Pratt looked up from his papers. ‘Did I miss something?’

‘Yes,’ said Marilyn, with a sigh. ‘And so did I.’

\*\*\*

When the judge came back in, Ron Buckley’s advocate stood up.

‘M’Lady,’ he started.

‘Unless you have new instructions, this is actually where I talk,’ snapped the judge.

‘I have new instructions, M’Lady,’ said Advocate Hart.

The judge put on her glasses. ‘And they are?’

‘M’Lady, it appears that in the break, my client has decided to cede all his parental rights to the Respondents and allow them to adopt the minor child, Ruby-Mae Browne.’

Jonathan Pratt stood up. ‘M’Lady, my instructions are the same.’

Judge Mathibe made as if to put her glasses on and then realised that they were already there. ‘I beg your pardon?’

Both counsel remained quiet.

‘And what, Counsel,’ she said, glaring at Ron Buckley’s team, ‘precipitated this about-turn?’

Advocate Hart shuffled his papers as if to find an explanation. ‘M’Lady, I’m unclear on why my client has had a change of heart, but my instruction is that he is adamant.’

‘He doesn’t want his child any more?’

‘That is correct, M’Lady.’

‘The same child that you have just spent several hours convincing me will be irreparably harmed if she has to spend another minute with the Respondents, who you would have me believe are perverted child abusers.’

‘Perhaps, M’Lady,’ said Advocate Hart, having been thrown a lifeline, ‘perhaps my client realised he was wrong about that.’

‘In a twenty-minute break?’ She looked around. ‘Has money changed hands?’ she demanded.

I held my breath. Both advocates turned to their clients.

‘No,’ said Sean to Jonathan, ‘no money has changed hands.’

Advocate Hart said, ‘M’Lady, my instructions are not.’

‘This accords with my instructions, M’Lady,’ said Jonathan.

‘You realise that I do not have to accept this?’ said the judge. ‘That my mandate is to act in the best interests of the child?’

I hadn’t realised this at all, and I felt my eyes fill up with tears.

‘M’Lady,’ said Jonathan, ‘may I take the liberty of pointing out that my clients did not bring this matter to this court. They were happy to allow the Applicant access to his daughter, and they have at all times acted in the child’s best interests. However, it is exactly this type of erratic and unthoughtful behaviour that has led them to defend this application. The minor child would not be better off with a man who will sign away his rights during a tea break.’

Advocate Hart turned to Ron Buckley, who shrugged but had the grace to look slightly bashful.

‘Don’t worry, Mr Hart,’ sighed the judge. ‘I get the message.’ She put her hands on her head for a moment. ‘Something ugly has happened here this morning,’ she eventually said. ‘I am left with a very bad taste in my mouth. However, I do believe that this outcome is in the best interests of the child. Application withdrawn. Applicant to pay wasted costs on an attorney-and-client scale. My time has been wasted.’

She stood up and the court stood with her. As soon as she had left, Marilyn and Jonathan turned to us.

‘So did we win?’ Sean looked confused.

‘Yes,’ said Marilyn drily. ‘And you have saddled Ron Buckley with your legal costs on a higher scale than usual.’

Jonathan rubbed the side of his nose. ‘What just happened here, guys?’ he said.

Sean took my hand, and when he spoke, it was with the firm, confident voice that I’d always loved. ‘A family just happened here. That’s what. Thank you for being part of that.’

Holding hands, we left the courtroom.

# Epilogue

I’m sitting in the playroom. It used to be a formal lounge, but with three children we’ve realised that a playroom is much more necessary. The afternoon sun reaches through the windows and baby Lilith – who we call Lili – is trying to catch sunbeams. She’s just started sitting and every time she reaches for one, she topples over and laughs.

Amy is sitting cross-legged next to me, colouring in. ‘Lili’s not very clever,’ she observes.

I laugh and kiss her. ‘She *is* clever,’ I say. ‘Just like her big sisters. I have the three cleverest girls in the world, all under one roof. It’s a miracle.’

And it certainly feels that way.

‘Ruby is not under the roof,’ says Amy pedantically. ‘Ruby is with her Bad Daddy.’

‘Blood Daddy,’ I correct automatically.

At the beginning, I was uncomfortable with the compromise we eventually reached – especially because we could have got away with not doing it. But the play therapist convinced me that, if Ron was willing, some relationship with him was in Ruby’s best interests. Ron got a job working for one of the big art expos that brings him to Joburg about once every three months. He takes Ruby to lunch, and sometimes to the zoo. Eugenie goes with, although she sits at another table and lags behind them at the zoo. Maybe one day we’ll feel safe letting Ron take Ruby on his own, but not yet. Still, even with Eugenie, I’m never completely comfortable with the arrangement, and I can’t wait to have my middle daughter home again.

‘Lili stinks,’ observes Amy, looking up from her page.

‘I think she has a poo,’ I say. ‘I’d better change her.’

I don’t know if she is summoned by the smell or my voice, but Gugu drifts into the room and scoops up Lili in her wiry arms. ‘Let’s change you, little thing,’ she says.

When Lili was born, I was determined that no girl would feel that I wasn’t paying them attention, and I tried to do everything for everyone. Sean watched this for two weeks, and then he arranged for Gugu and my mother to babysit, and took me out for dinner.

‘You’re going to have a breakdown,’ he said. ‘And that won’t help anyone. You need to ask for help and accept help. You need to use me. You need to use Gugu. You need to use your mother. You need to use your friends who are all gagging for time with the girls – Eugenie and Lerato and Joanne and Trixie. And you need to see that spending a little time alone with each girl is worth a lot more than spending all your time going crazy with all three.’

Giving a woman advice about mothering two weeks after she’s had a baby is probably not the best move. First I cried, and then I told him that he didn’t understand. And then I almost immediately told him that he was absolutely right and that I needed him and loved him. And then my milk started leaking and we had to go home.

But I listened. Sometimes I have to remind myself, give myself little talks about how I have to let the village help raise the children or I will lose myself. And I will be no good to my girls if my self is lost.

I can hear Lili gurgling to Gugu as they walk down the passage, and Amy is now hard at work gluing glitter and sequins to her picture. ‘She little artist,’ Trixie has once observed. ‘It in genes.’ And then she’d blushed – a roaring crimson that flooded her face. I was, of course, delighted.

Thinking of Joanne and Trixie makes me glance up at the wall. To where the Picasso used to hang: the Picasso that Sean used to bribe Ron.

For a long time, we expected to hear from Ron, telling us that it wasn’t worth what he’d thought and that we’d tricked him. But he hasn’t said anything. Either he hasn’t tried to sell it, or he’s too embarrassed to admit his mistake – ‘Or maybe he just really wanted a Picasso,’ suggested Eugenie. Sean agrees with her but I still can’t believe that.

In place of the Picasso, I’ve hung a family portrait that I painted, making us all different breeds of dogs and with some of our friends in the background. When Joanne saw it, her agent’s brain went into overdrive and now I have a waiting list of families wanting custom-made Dog family portraits. They cost a fortune, and if I was slow before, I’m now really, really slow, which makes them even more valuable. But the best part is that Sean has designed an app to help with the turnaround time. People upload their photos and some personal information so that I can get an idea of who they are without wasting time on scheduled meetings.

When I mentioned the app to Clarissa, she got excited about how it could be used for the adoption process. Sean and Clarissa then worked together on an app that uploads all the potential parents’ information and then cross-references it to other sources: Home Affairs to check your identity, your bank to check that you have the account that you say you do, universities to check that you have the qualifications you claim, and a separate aspect where your doctor can upload your medical information. They’ve sold the app to government to be rolled out under their supervision – for R25 million over the next three years. And right now, they’re in a meeting with a massive recruiter to look at how they can create a similar app for job seekers. So it doesn’t really matter how slow I am at painting.

Sean wasn’t really comfortable with how much the government paid them – he muttered a lot about ‘wasting tax payers’ money,’ an issue he probably feels more strongly about now that he pays so much tax. But then we talked about it, and we decided to sponsor a home for kids who aren’t as lucky as Amy and Ruby, with a particular focus on providing nurturing caregivers and a good education. It’s called ‘It Takes a Village’, and Sean got a few other businesses – including Eugenie’s sex shop! – to join him in funding the project. Clarissa is very involved, and she loves it. Sometimes, I take my three girls to play with the children there. Sometimes it’s hard not to bring more children home.

Then again, there are also days when it’s hard not to leave my girls there.

When Lili was born, I started taking the girls to the park again. Lili’s birth in many ways felt like a closure on the time that came before it, and I thought that I was ready to face the memories of the past. Our first visit was uneventful and it felt like I had made the right decision. But the second time we went, me and my three girls, we saw Rose. She was sitting with two other women in the place we always used to sit, and the three of them were deep in conversation. The two strangers were both turned to Rose like flowers to the sun, and Rose was gesticulating and laughing. My eyes scanned the playground, and I saw Maggie playing on the slide with a little girl and two boys. Lili was wrapped up against my chest and I could feel my heart pounding so hard against her body that I was surprised she didn’t wake up. For a moment, I thought I could brazen it out, but when I realised my hands were shaking, I knew we had to leave.

‘Girls,’ I said, ‘I’ve just remembered that there is a special on teddy bears at the toy shop. I think we’d better go now.’ Amy and Ruby looked confused, but were both incapable of resisting the words ‘teddy bear’ and ‘toy shop’. We turned towards the car, and when I looked back, Rose was staring at me. For a moment, she lifted her had as if she was going to wave, as if nothing had happened. But she dropped it half way, and turned back to her new friends.

After that, we found another park to visit. And I now keep myself separate from the families we met there.

I hear the gate opening, and shortly after that, the opening and closing of several car doors. That’s Eugenie with Ruby, and Sean has arrived home at the same time.

I get up to open the front door, and I lift Ruby up and give her a big kiss. ‘All good?’ I ask Eugenie.

She smiles. ‘All good.’

Sean gives Amy and Ruby a hug, and then goes to find Lili.

He comes back holding her, lifting her small body and blowing raspberries onto her stomach, which she finds hilarious.

‘That baby is so stupid,’ says Amy to Ruby.

‘I know,’ says Ruby. ‘I think we should have got a puppy.’

Amy nods, and I watch as they run off to their room.

‘Poor Lili,’ says Eugenie. ‘Maybe you should have another one so she isn’t always the third wheel.’

Sean and I both laugh, but I see him giving me an appraising glance, and I know there’ll soon be a conversation. I’m not sure how I feel, but if I’ve learnt anything this last year, it’s that you never know how things will turn out.

‘Oh, you,’ I say to Sean. ‘Stop having bright ideas, and go get that braai started. Lerato will be here in half an hour and she’s bringing her new boyfriend. An unmarried one, so perhaps we can all try not to scare him off?’

Eugenie looks at me and Sean, and at baby Lili, who has a finger up Sean’s nose. She glances to where the girls have disappeared out the door.

‘If anything in this house scares him off, he’s a fool,’ she says.

‘You just think that because you’re family,’ says Sean, putting his free arm around her bulk.

Eugenie smiles. ‘There isn’t a family I would rather have,’ she says. ‘That Lilith sure knew what she was doing.’

I smile at Sean. She sure did.

# Acknowledgements

The idea for this book came to me a few years ago, when my friend Jeanne Gaylard left me with her children in a park, and took slightly longer than I had expected. By the time she returned, the book had been born. So the first thank you must be to Jeanne.

The next step of the writing took more research than I am used to, and I am so grateful to Jo-Anne Schermeier, the manager of the Princess Alice Adoption Home in Westcliff, for the time she spent explaining adoption processes to me. Matthew van der Want and Philippa Kruger spent ages with me explaining exactly how different ideas that I had would play out in court, and explaining various legal nuances of matters involving child custody. Matthew and his team at Van Der Want Attorneys then did a second check for me when the book was complete.

Twitter is the most amazing resource, and it helped me in two ways during the writing of this book. Firstly, I had a wonderfully useful discussion about their experiences with various mothers who have experienced cross-race adoptions. It was some time ago, and I can’t find the original tweets, but I know that I owe thanks to Sharon van Wyk, who blogs as The Blessed Barrenness (@SharonVW) and Melinda Connor (@melindaconnor) for sharing their experiences with me. Apologies to anyone else who took part in those conversations who I have not named.

And then, when I hit a slump in my writing, Twitter again came to my aid in the form of Pamela Power (@pamelapower) and Casey B Dolan (@CaseyBDolan). The three of us started a weekly check in which we called #writersgym, and we kept each other on target for our word count targets. It literally kept me writing.

Ester Levinrad read an early draft of this book and gave me most useful feedback. Thank you.

I have been welcomed with such open arms by my new publishers at Pan Macmillan, with especial thanks to Terry Morris and Andrea Nattrass, who have been so supportive and kind. One act of kindness was to allow me to keep my previous editor, Nicola Rijsdijk. I am not convinced that I can actually write a book without Nicola. She is a wonderful editor and has become a good friend.

This is a book about female friendships, so I have dedicated it to my best friend of almost thirty years. But my grateful thanks to all my other good, close, supportive female friends – with especial thanks to Kira Magowen, who endures endless cups of tea with me.

As this book hits the shelves, my husband, Paul van Onselen, and I will have been together for twenty years. His support is unwavering, and sometimes he even reads what I have written. My thanks to him and our two children, Thomas and Megan, who give my heart its beat.

# After

In the beginning, the biggest challenge was Ruby herself.

She cried for Lilith every night, and searched for her every morning. I took the studio portraits Lilith had included in the baby book, and had them blown up and framed. I put a photo of Lilith and Ruby on the wall near her bed in Amy’s room, and a different one on the wall with our family photos. I thought about having some of the baby photos framed for the wall, but we still had no idea what had happened to Lilith, and I didn’t want to jump the gun.

The police phoned us every day for the first few days, asking if we’d heard news and, if we pushed them, telling us what they had done, which mostly seemed to be monitoring ATM use and phoning the same hospitals we’d phoned the first day. Lilith’s bank account, which they had located, remained untouched. They’d also looked at her account history. In the last few days before her disappearance, there’d been a payment of the school fees in full, and almost all the cash had been withdrawn.

‘Wherever she is,’ said Nombi, the only time she phoned herself, ‘she’s living off cash for now. We’ll keep monitoring, but it’s unlikely anything more will happen on this side.’

But she wouldn’t tell me how much money had been withdrawn, so I had no idea if I should be looking for Lilith in a hotel or under a bridge.

‘I never got the feeling she had much money,’ said Eugenie in one of our daily phone calls while she was away in Port Elizabeth.

‘Neither did I,’ I said. ‘But I also never got the feeling she’d abandon Ruby. So what the fuck do I know?’

Rose had phoned me on the Friday ten days after Lilith had failed to appear.

It was strange. On one hand, my life felt completely suspended – like nothing could happen until we found Lilith, and like every moment of every day was devoted to this cause. But on the other, things went on. I looked after the day-to-day needs of the girls, especially Ruby, who was needy and clingy. I looked after the day-to-day needs of my pregnancy, taking supplements and making appointments and planning and dreaming.

But some things were gone. Going to the park was gone – I didn’t think I would ever be able to go back there, especially as it would remind Ruby of Lilith being with us. And my work. My work was beyond me. I was surviving.

‘How’s things?’ Rose said, on the phone. ‘Must be a relief to have Ruby back with Lilith.’

There was a time that Rose might have been the first person I would’ve called after everything happened. And she suddenly seemed to be the one person I wanted to talk to, because she knew Lilith better than anyone else I knew, except Eugenie.

‘Rose,’ I said, ‘you are basically not going to believe what has happened. I’d love to see you and tell you properly. Can you pop by?’

‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Rose without any explanation. But when I started the story, she apparently changed her mind. ‘I’m coming over,’ she said. ‘I’ll reschedule my thing. Oh my God, Rebecca, you should have called me.’

She arrived twenty minutes later with Maggie in tow, and a bag full of ready meals.

‘I didn’t know what would help,’ she said, ‘so I got it into my head that you might not have time to cook. But then I realised that doesn’t even make sense, but by then I’d bought all this, so here it is.’

I laughed, enjoying Rose’s characteristic waterfall of words. ‘I’ve missed you,’ I said.

She gave me a quick hug. ‘Now tell me everything.’

So I did. I told her everything, and she was very sympathetic and asked lots of the right questions. In the moment, I even told her about my pregnancy, which we were trying not to spread too wide ‘just in case’. But it seemed wrong that Eugenie and Clarissa knew and not Rose. I told her about the foster hearing that had been set down to be heard in two weeks’ time, and about how sad Ruby seemed. We discussed what I could do to help Ruby, and Rose gushed about how she’d be happy to help any time.

‘Rose,’ I said, after we’d drunk two cups of tea, and I’d covered the story from just about every angle, ‘do you think there’s a chance that at the beginning Lilith was ...’ I paused. I’d struggled even thinking about this, let alone putting it into words. ‘Do you think she was kind of scoping us out?’

‘What do you mean?’ said Rose.

‘Like the way she used to interview everyone in the park,’ I said. ‘And the way she took us for that lunch and told us all about Ruby’s father.’

‘Yes, I remember all that,’ Rose said slowly. ‘But what do you mean, scoping us out?’

‘I mean, do you think she was choosing someone to abandon Ruby with?’ I finally put what I’d been thinking into words. ‘Do you think that she’d always planned to do this, and was just choosing who it would be?’ It was a relief to say it, and I looked at Rose, anxious for her answer.

‘You think she *chose* you?’ said Rose.

‘Yes.’ I felt glad she’d understood.

‘Over everyone else.’ The curiosity and enthusiasm that had permeated Rose’s whole being up till then was suddenly gone.

I felt wrong-footed, but I wasn’t sure why. I *did* think that Lilith had chosen me, and I was horrified by it. Horrified by how passively I’d been part of someone else’s grand scheme, how cluelessly I’d fulfilled my role. Basically, what I was looking for was someone to tell me I was crazy. And Rose was the only other person who would know.

I started trying to put this into words, but Rose cut me off.

‘I get you’re a famous artist and all that, Rebecca,’ she said, ‘but I don’t think you’re such a great mother that you’re better than anyone else.’

‘That’s not what I’m saying. That’s not what I’m saying at all.’

‘Well, it sounds like you are.’

‘No, I’m just saying ...’ But now I didn’t know any more, because even I could see that in a way I was suggesting that Lilith had thought I was the best choice.

‘Well,’ said Rose, folding her arms, ‘what are you *just saying*?’

‘I’m not saying that I’m the best choice,’ I said. ‘I’m just saying that for some reason I was what Lilith was looking for. Maybe it was the whole adoption thing.’ That felt weak, but Rose seemed to relax. She uncrossed her arms, and her shoulders visibly dropped.

‘I suppose the adoption thing does show that you’re open to taking in waifs and strays,’ she mused.

I wasn’t sure that this was happening. Had Rose really just called my daughter a waif and a stray?

‘What?’ I said.

‘Oh, you know what I mean,’ said Rose, waving her hand. ‘Anyhoo. About time Maggie and I got out from under your feet. It must be so much work with an extra mouth to feed.’

Rose left in a whirl of scarves and Maggie and lost shoes and bags forgotten inside. I breathed a sigh of relief and disbelief when she left, and set about the task of making supper. At least Rose had brought those ready-made meals, I thought. That would do for Sean and I.

But when I looked for the packet that I had put in the freezer, it wasn’t there. I couldn’t find it anywhere. It was a mystery, but not exactly the biggest one I was about to contend with.

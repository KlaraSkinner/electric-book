Lunch with Rose and Lilith, and the strange conversation about husbands and Ruby-Mae’s father, left me thinking about Sean. About what it was that had led us to the place we were: where we’d embarked on a new course of fertility treatment that was making me feel violated, and I couldn’t find the words to tell him.

I met Sean at my first Dog Show – the one Joanne had arranged after she’d sold the first few works. I’d been vaguely dating an engineer called Martin before that, but it wasn’t particularly intense and when I’d knuckled down to produce the fifty works Joanne had demanded of me, the relationship petered out. I don’t think Martin was particularly bereft, and I certainly wasn’t. I was completely focused on my first major show, and elated when I actually achieved the output.

On the day of the opening, Joanne and Trixie (her partner, both in business and in life) had rushed around the gallery trying to decide which works to hang, stopping occasionally to make pronouncements about my talent. This was especially gratifying from Trixie, who is a formidably elegant and initially cold Japanese woman who had never deigned to speak to me before. Suddenly, while lifting a small, framed purple dachshund frolicking in some daffodils, Trixie stopped dead in her tracks. She put the painting down and turned towards me, a finger on her cheek. She contemplated me much as she’d just contemplated the paintings that were hanging on the wall.

‘Joanne,’ she suddenly hollered, although she didn’t wait for a response. ‘Sending Rebecca to Jonas. Is only answer.’

Joanne looked up from the painting she’d been eyeing and pushed her blonde hair back from her eyes. ‘Okay, sweetheart,’ she said.

I always found the word ‘sweetheart’ a bit hard to swallow in the context of someone as scary as Trixie. If she was my life partner, I’d probably call her Sergeant-Major.

Trixie took her phone out of her pocket, and keyed in a single number – whoever it was was obviously on speed dial. I glanced at Joanne for an explanation, but Trixie started yelling at her phone in what I presumed was Japanese, and Joanne wandered into another room. To be honest, I was too afraid of Trixie to move. The only bit of the conversation I understood was when Trixie yelled, ‘Full works. Emergency.’

Apparently that got her what she wanted, because she soon hung up and scribbled an address on a piece of paper.

‘Jonas is waiting,’ she said, in her usual clipped voice. To this day I’m not sure if it is an accent, or just how she speaks. I was about to ask her for more information, when she yelled, ‘Go. Go. Jonas will not wait forever.’

So I left, with absolutely no idea of what to expect, and obediently drove myself to the address on the paper. To my relief it turned out to be a beauty salon and not one of the many more colourful things I’d been imagining.

I presented myself at the reception desk, and as soon as I muttered, ‘I’m Rebecca. Jonas is expecting me, I think,’ a flurry of Japanese women appeared from behind a screen and, clucking like excited hens, led me through a door. They sat me down in front of a mirror and disappeared, and I was briefly alone in a large room, which contained only a full-length mirror, my chair and, hanging from the ceiling, an empty bamboo bird cage.

I wondered if I should be offended that I’d been found so wanting, but the truth is, compared to Trixie, I clearly was. After just enough time had passed to make me feel really uncomfortable, a small Japanese man emerged from one of the three doors leading off the room.

‘Hi,’ I said brightly.

He just shook his head sadly, looking me up and down. Then he came a bit closer and touched my hair like you might touch a dead thing left on your doormat by a cat.

‘Bad, bad hair,’ he muttered. ‘Bad.’ He sighed deeply, and reached for his phone. ‘Trixie!’ he yelled, and launched into Japanese, presumably to tell Trixie the extent of the unacceptability of my hair, and possibly my whole self. Or perhaps he was angry with Trixie for introducing such horror into his life. Either way, he was clearly a very brave man, shouting at Trixie like that.

I just sat there, feeling strangely passive about the process.

Eventually, the man I presumed to be Jonas hung up, and sighed again. ‘Rebecca,’ he said, ‘this is bad, bad hair.’

‘I’m sorry,’ I ventured.

‘But I will do my best. Because you are friend of Trixie. And she is very great woman.’

‘Ah,’ I said, unable to agree that I was indeed a friend of Trixie’s, or that she was a great woman.

‘Trixie says that you too are very great woman.’ Jonas sighed. ‘With bad, bad hair.’ He glanced at me. ‘And I can’t even talk about your eyebrows. It is too painful for me.’ He placed his hand over his heart to indicate the source of his pain.

We both contemplated my bad hair and eyebrows in the mirror for a moment, and then Jonas clapped his hands twice, hard. The women who had led me to the room reappeared, twittering amongst themselves.

‘Prepare her,’ Jonas said, waving his hand towards me, and left again.

Strangely, despite the bad, bad hair and the eyebrows that caused Jonas such pain, the rest of the afternoon passed extremely pleasantly. I was massaged, my hair was washed, I was given a manicure and a pedicure, my make-up was tastefully done and, of course, Jonas tamed my bad, bad hair into what he described as, ‘Better. Obedient hair.’ Most bizarrely, an outfit was produced from behind a door. An outfit that I expected to hate but which was, in fact, so exactly me that I was speechless: flowing black pants, and a silky top with a motif of tiny butterflies, and a neckline that showed off my cleavage. I looked lovely – a svelte Japanese version of my usual uncontained self.

When I got back to the gallery, Joanne clapped her hands and said that I looked lovely. Trixie looked me up and down, and nodded. ‘Better,’ she said. High praise.

My makeover gave me new courage and a new persona. At the opening, I greeted my friends more effusively, gesturing with my perfectly manicured hands as I spoke. I laughed a bit louder, and drank more than usual from martini glasses filled with unusual-coloured liquids. It was my night, and it felt like it. And at the end of the night, eighty per cent of the paintings had red ‘sold’ stickers on them, and the remaining paintings sold over the course of the next three days. Joanne declared it their most successful exhibition ever, and Trixie said, ‘Was nice.’

And in the middle of that magical night, I met Sean. My brother, Carl, had brought a big group of his friends, most of whom I already knew. They all gushed about my new look in a most satisfactory way, and flirted with me as if I was the prize of the evening. I *was* the prize of the evening. But one man held back, sipping a glass of red wine and looking quietly at the pictures.

There was something about him that immediately attracted me. It sounds awful to say, but it related to how normal he looked, how sound. He was perhaps a bit taller than most men (six foot two inches, I later learnt) and a bit better looking than most men, with his sandy hair and wide smile, and brown eyes that sparkled. But he wasn’t *too* tall, or *too* good-looking. He was a man who looked real – not too good to be true.

I watched him for a bit, waiting for him to look at me, but he didn’t. He looked at the paintings, and then chatted to a few of his friends who weren’t swarming around me, having handed that baton to others. I grabbed my brother’s sleeve.

‘Carl, who is that?’ I asked.

Carl looked. ‘He’s a friend of Grant’s. Sam, I think. Or maybe Patrick.’

‘Sam or Patrick?’ I said. ‘How the hell are those two names similar?’

Carl shrugged. ‘Never said they were.’ My brother can be infuriating.

‘Introduce me,’ I said.

Carl looked at me like I was bats. ‘I can’t introduce you. I don’t know his name.’

So I did it myself. I walked over to him, and his friends seemed to sense something and wondered off. ‘Hi,’ I said, ‘I’m Rebecca.’

He smiled, and I caught a glimpse of the way his face would age – all laugh lines and dimples.

‘I know,’ he said. ‘You’re the very talented lady of the moment.’

‘Yes,’ I said, because in my Japanese-chic persona, I could accept compliments; the real Rebecca is completely tongue tied by the merest hint of one.

‘I’m Sean,’ he said, holding out his hand for me to shake.

I took it. ‘Neither Sam nor Patrick,’ I said.

He must have thought I was totally nuts, or maybe that this was artist talk, because he barely batted an eyelid. ‘Neither Sam nor Patrick,’ he said. ‘I hope you won’t hold that against me.’

I’m not a flirty type of woman. I don’t come up with clever lines, or come on to strange men. But to Sean Prince, on the night of my sell-out opening, I said, rather saucily, ‘I won’t hold that ... against you.’

And after a few more rounds of the room, and a few more drinks, I went home with him, thinking I was having the first one-night stand of my life. No good should come of a relationship started with such wanton and clichéd behaviour.

Instead, two years later, when I was twenty-eight and he was thirty-two, I married him.

On the day I had lunch with Lilith, I thought about the Sean I had fallen in love with: the way he can have fun, but approaches life with a sensible edge; the way he never goes into debt, but can still spend money freely; the way he laughs, but is never insensitive; the way he approaches life with both questions and answers. And I recognised that, like so many wives through time, the very things I loved were starting to drive me mad. If I complained about a day with Amy, he suggested I leave her with Gugu and have a day to myself. He’d say it in a calculatedly calm voice, like you’d use to someone standing on a ledge: ‘Come off that ledge, Rebecca, let’s talk it out’.

Sometimes those days, because it felt like I *was* standing on a ledge, well, Sean’s calm voice could have made me jump. Because I heard what I hadn’t before – a certain level of judgement; a belief in his own sensibleness. What at the beginning seemed calm and reliable now sometimes sounded like a constant barrage of ‘I know better’.

I thought about what Lilith had told Rose and me, and I felt bad. Lilith had been with a man who would have pushed her off the ledge, so how could I complain about my lovely, calm and sensible husband?

I decided I would talk to him again, appeal to the lovely man I married, and try to make him see how angry this new attempt at IVF – which we hadn’t even started yet – had made me feel.

\*

I made us a nice supper, putting in more effort than I had lately. Over oxtail, I brought up the subject.

‘Sean,’ I said, ‘I’m not really feeling happy about this decision to try IVF again.’

Sean put down his fork. ‘I thought we’d agreed,’ he said in his Rebecca’s-on-the-ledge voice. ‘I thought this decision was made.’

‘It was. But I’m not happy about the decision we’ve made, and I want us to talk about it some more.’

‘Well, Rebecca,’ he said, ‘what would you like to do?’

I ignored his tone, trying hard to respond rationally.

‘I’d like us to start adoption proceedings again. I want to adopt another child.’

Sean steepled his fingers – a sure sign that he believed what he was about to say was eminently sensible.

‘All I am asking is for us to try one more cycle of IVF,’ he said. ‘After that, if it doesn’t work, we go back to adoption.’ He leant forward. ‘We can even start the adoption process at the same time.’

‘I just don’t understand,’ I blurted out. ‘Don’t you love Amy?’

Sean backed away like I’d slapped him. ‘How can you ask me that? I love you and Amy more than anything, anything, in the world.’

‘Then why do you want to try for ...’ I stopped myself. I had been about to say ‘our own baby’. But Sean obviously understood me.

He looked at his plate and breathed out. ‘This is going to sound stupid,’ he said.

‘Try me.’

‘I feel like if we adopt another child, we’ll take something away from the special way we got Amy,’ he said. ‘But if we give birth to this one, then they’ll both be special.’ He stopped, and looked at me. ‘I told you it was stupid.’

‘No,’ I said. ‘It’s ...’ I searched for the right words, his motives recalibrating in my brain. ‘It’s actually rather lovely.’ I reached for his hand. ‘*You’re* actually rather lovely.’

‘So can we try?’ he said.

I nodded. ‘I guess we can.’ I paused. ‘But if it doesn’t work the first time, I get to decide if we try again.’

‘Totally,’ agreed Sean, and we went back to our supper, and I told him a bit about my lunch with the girls, including Lilith’s terrible story.

I made an appointment at the fertility clinic the next morning.

\*

Dr Stevenson greeted me warmly, as if it hadn’t been more than three years since he’d last seen me. Not for the first time, I thought about how useful doctors’ files must be in helping them act like they remember their patients.

I explained the situation to Dr Stevenson, and he seemed enthusiastic about us trying again, saying that often variables change with the passing of time, and that couples who have struggled can suddenly react better to fertility treatment. We established that, counting from my last cycle, I was on about day twelve of my cycle, and that if it was a healthy cycle, my egg should be almost ready to release.

‘Hop on the table,’ said Dr Stevenson – words I’d heard him say so often in the past. ‘Let’s take a look.’

One of the things that happens when you have fertility treatment is that you lose any squeamishness about gynaecological examinations. I thought maybe I would find it strange after the time that had passed, but as Dr Stevenson slid the incongruous condom over the scanner, it felt like just yesterday that I’d last had this scan.

‘Your ovaries look good,’ Dr Stevenson said a few minutes later. ‘One has a great, healthy egg growing in it. The other looks healthy – no cysts. Your lining is also looking great.’ He smiled, and finished the scan. ‘Get dressed, and let’s chat.’

Back at his desk, he was flipping through my file.

‘Here’s my idea, Rebecca,’ he said as I sat down. ‘That egg looks so great, and obviously this cycle is far too far along to do IVF. So I’d like to try artificial insemination during this cycle. It’s probably a long shot, but let’s try. If it doesn’t work, then I suggest we do an IVF cycle.’

I hadn’t really expected to move so quickly. ‘When would we do the AI?’ I asked, slipping into the jargon like an old cardigan.

‘You’d come in for an injection first thing tomorrow, to make sure the egg releases, and then you and Sean would need to come in with a fresh sperm sample the next day.’

‘That’s quick,’ I said.

‘I know,’ said Dr Stevenson. ‘You don’t have to, of course. But what’s the harm?’

‘Eight grand?’ I said, and Dr Stevenson had the grace to look embarrassed.

I felt bad. The money wasn’t really a problem. My low work output ironically meant that when I did paint a Dog, they sold for even more. One big painting would sort out this whole process.

‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Let’s do it.’

I left the clinic feeling slightly overwhelmed, and a bit ambushed. But underneath that, I felt something else. Something I hadn’t really expected.

I felt excited.

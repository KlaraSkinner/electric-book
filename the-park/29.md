# Post

Sean was sure we were done with Ron Buckley.

‘That guy was just looking to make trouble,’ he said. ‘He hadn’t thought it through. When he realised he might end up with a three year old to support, he bolted.’

I nodded, and said I was sure that he was right. But I wasn’t. Ron Buckley was a stupid, abusive and arrogant man, and I didn’t think we’d heard the last from him. I hoped that Sean was right though, and I tried to quell my fears.

And there were other things going on. Overnight, I’d gone from being an infertile mother of one to a pregnant mother of two. I’d been getting by on adrenaline, but as the days passed, and we heard nothing more from Ron Buckley, my new life began to take its toll. Parenting was that much harder these days: Ruby was a bereaved and confused little girl, and, without any forewarning, Amy had been forced into being a sibling, and sharing me and Sean. Both girls were acting up, so on Clarissa’s advice I took them both to play therapy – an expense we could ill afford these days. Without me painting, Sean’s business wasn’t quite overcoming the hump that meant we were financially safe. The good news was that the play therapist assured me that Amy and Ruby were just normal little girls adjusting as well as they could to an abnormal situation. But it was still tough on them.

It was a Thursday when we decided to tell them about the baby. Sean came home early, and we made home-made pizzas together. When the girls were relaxed and drinking their chocolate milks, Sean started.

‘So, girls,’ he said, ‘you know that we are so excited because we’ve grown as a family and now Ruby is part of it?’

Ruby nodded and Amy blew bubbles in her milk.

‘Well, Mommy and I want to tell you another exciting piece of news.’

‘Mommy’s dead,’ said Ruby.

‘No, she’s not,’ said Amy.

‘Rubes,’ said Sean, ‘when I say “Mommy”, I mean Rebecca. I know your special mommy is dead and we are so sad because we miss her. But we need a name for Rebecca that we can all share.’

Ruby and Amy looked at him blankly, and I sighed. Sean sounded like he’d swallowed a pop psychology book, and it was true that the pile of parenting manuals on both of our bedsides would have put a small bookshop to shame.

‘So anyhow,’ I took over, ‘the exciting news is that I have a baby growing in my tummy, and in about six months the baby is going to be born, and we’ll have a new brother or sister in the house.’

Sean looked pissed off that I had stolen his thunder, but Amy’s eyes were wide.

‘A sister or brother. For Amy,’ she said.

I smiled. ‘Yes. And for Ruby.’

‘No,’ said Amy, ‘only for me. Ruby’s not a sister and this baby’s not for Ruby.’

‘Amy,’ I said, ‘families get made in different ways. Ruby is now a sister, and the baby will be a sister or a brother to both of you.’

Amy looked at me with those heartbreaking, big brown eyes, and for a moment our souls connected in that way I often felt could only happen with her – my first child, and for so long, my only child.

‘Mommy,’ she said in a soft voice, ‘let’s just get a puppy.’ She climbed onto my lap and put a thumb in her mouth, a habit she’d long ago stopped. ‘Sometimes,’ she said, stroking my hair with her free hand, ‘I want to be just me and Mommy.’

I wanted to say, ‘Me too,’ but I couldn’t, because Ruby’s clear-blue eyes seemed to be examining my thoughts.

Sean stepped in. ‘Looks like Amy needs some special Mommy time, am I right?’ he said. Amy nodded, her head against my chest. ‘And I bet Ruby could use a cuddle from me,’ he said, picking up Ruby. ‘And then how about a walk?’

Ruby nodded and after a few moments Sean lifted her down and made a move to start their walk.

‘Could you stop at number 109 and see if those Blundys have anything of ours?’ I said over Amy’s head. ‘I haven’t been for a while and she never delivers our post here.’

‘Sure,’ said Sean. ‘Come on, Ruby-Tuesday.’

‘It’s Ruby Ruby,’ said Ruby, taking his hand.

I blew her a kiss. ‘Have a good walk, guys.’

It felt like a treat, I admit, having a small window of time with just Amy. I knew I needed to make this happen more often, and that I had to do it for Ruby too, and for the baby when it came. I sighed as I buried my face in Amy’s hair. Everything had become so complicated since those days in the park. I wrapped my arms around Amy as I watched Sean and Ruby walk out the gate, hand in hand, Ruby’s head moving as she chatted away. I felt a taste of the resentment that Amy must have felt when she saw us with Ruby, but I also felt a wave of love for that small blonde shape – more intense than I had ever felt for her before. I thought that I would talk to Sean about all these mixed feelings when he got back; see if he felt similarly torn.

But when Sean came back from the walk, he was livid.

‘That Mrs Blundy,’ he said, throwing down a pile of post on the table, ‘is a world-class, absolute selfish bitch. Excuse me, girls – please don’t repeat anything Daddy says.’

I nodded. ‘Holding on to our post again?’

‘Fuck the post,’ said Sean. ‘Oh, er, Amy and Ruby, I think I can hear your dollies calling you.’ The girls smiled at Sean and ran off. ‘That’s my girls,’ he called after them.

I was impressed – that approach never worked when I tried it.

‘Rebecca, that woman. That woman is so bad she’s like ...’ He waved his arms in the air as if hoping to summon a strong enough comparison. ‘She’s like my *mother*,’ he eventually said.

‘Oh, darling,’ I said, without stopping to think. ‘Nobody’s that bad.’

Sean looked stunned for a moment. ‘Actually,’ he said in a less hysterical voice, ‘Mrs Blundy is.’

‘What happened?’ I picked up the post.

‘She looked at me and she looked at Ruby and then she said she was so glad we’d stopped our charity nonsense and decided to look after our own child.’

The post felt heavy in my hands.

‘Then,’ said Sean, ‘when I asked her what she was talking about, she said she didn’t hold with this business of bringing darkies into the suburbs.’

I was speechless, heavy with the knowledge that this sort of comparison would become even more part of our lives now than it had before. In our eyes, Amy would always be our firstborn, but in the eyes of the world, she would be the odd one out. Especially when the baby came. I ran my hand through my hair.

‘I think I’m going to lay a charge,’ said Sean.

I laughed. ‘Of what? Rudeness? Racism? If the police had to investigate every incident of racism, the whole system would fall apart.’

‘You just can’t go around saying things like that,’ said Sean. ‘There must be something we can do.’

I started sorting the post again, putting bills on one side and junk mail on the other.

‘We could get Lerato or Marilyn to write a letter telling her that if it happens in front of the kids again, we’ll lay a charge. And that we’ll regard as theft her keeping any post for more than a week. Yes, that’s it ...’ Sean continued.

But I wasn’t listening. I was looking at the bulging envelope in my hand. Cold tendrils reached up my neck.

‘Sean,’ I said, but my voice came out as a squeak, and he carried on. ‘Sean,’ I said more loudly.

‘What?’

‘This is Lilith’s handwriting,’ I said. ‘This is from Lilith. I recognise her handwriting.’

He took the envelope. ‘This was sent three months ago,’ he said. ‘When this all started.’

We looked at each other.

‘Open it,’ he said eventually.

The first thing I removed from the envelope was a list in Lilith’s handwriting. It was written on plain lined paper, and looked like it’d been torn from a notebook. In lines written with different pens it said:

[digi note: circle “Rebecca” – she has made her choice; and above, “gut feel” to be underlined]

I held out the paper to Sean.

‘This is how she chose,’ I said. ‘I knew it. I knew there was some sort of process she must have followed.’

Sean looked at it. ‘I don’t know if this is what I would call a process, Rebecca,’ he said. ‘It seems a bit arbitrary.’

‘It’s her way of telling me how she chose me. And she’s giving me a touchstone for parenting Ruby.’

Sean raised his eyebrows. ‘If you say so,’ he said, opening a folded wad of typed papers. ‘Oh my God, yes! It’s a will.’ He scanned through it. ‘There’s a savings account being held for Ruby,’ he muttered. He looked at me and then read: ‘*I appoint Rebecca Prince as Ruby-Mae Browne’s legal guardian until such time as she reaches majority. I appoint Sean Prince as the executor of my estate. Should Rebecca Prince die prior to Ruby-Mae Prince attaining majority, I appoint Sean Prince as her legal guardian.*’

I was about to interrupt but he held up his hand, and carried on reading.

‘*I wish to make it clear that under no circumstances should Ruby-Mae’s natural father be sought or allowed to have any rights in relation to her*. This is it. This is what we’ve been waiting for.’

‘Isn’t it a bit weird that she didn’t even entertain the idea that we might refuse?’ I asked, thinking aloud. ‘Shouldn’t she have made a back-up plan, like we have?’ In our will we’d made Sean’s sister guardian, and failing her, my brother Carl. I made a mental note that we’d have to update our will now that we had all these children, and make it clear that Ruby counted as our child.

‘Why would she need a back-up plan?’ said Sean. ‘She knew we wouldn’t say no.’ He waved the papers at me again. ‘I’m phoning Marilyn. Even if Ron comes back, it’s a slam dunk.’

But when Sean got off the phone, he was less excited.

‘She says it helps,’ he said, ‘but that Ron Buckley still has rights if he chooses to fight for them.’

‘Well,’ I said, ‘so far he’s been quiet, so let’s just hold thumbs that he’s changed his mind.’

‘I wish we could get something from him renouncing his rights,’ said Sean. ‘So that we don’t have to live with the worry.’

‘Maybe we can ask Marilyn about that. But not right now,’ I added as Sean reached for his phone. ‘It’s not urgent.’

But the next day’s call to Marilyn was urgent.
